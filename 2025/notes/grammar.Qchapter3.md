# Chapter 3
## One to Many: Forming Plurals of Nouns and Pronouns
According to one website, as of January, 2013, the English language was made up of - 1,019, 729.	 6 words. I don’t believe that anyone actually knows — or can know — how - many words are in any language. (And what on earth is 0.6 of a word?) So you can forget - about numbers when you study proper English, with one huge exception: You have to pay - attention to singular and plural forms of nouns and pronouns. In this chapter, you practice - with nouns, turning one (the singular form) into many (the plural form). You also sort - singular and plural pronouns, so that you can match them appropriately with the words - they represent.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that cover the following concepts:
✓	Forming plurals of common and proper nouns, both regular and irregular
✓	Creating plural forms of hyphenated and compound words
✓	Tackling difficult pronouns such as everything, one, either, all, some, that, which who, and so forth What to watch out for

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Most nouns form the plural by adding the letter s. For nouns ending in ch, sh, x, s, and z, add es.
✓	Nouns ending in a y change the y to i and add es if the letter preceding the y is a consonant (any letter except a, e, i, o, or u).
✓	Add s or es to the most important word in a hyphenated or compound noun.
✓	These pronouns are always singular: one, everyone, everything, everybody, no one,
nothing, nobody, someone, something, somebody, either, neither, each, other, and another.
✓	These pronouns are always plural: few, both, several, and many.
✓	Relative pronouns (that, which, who) are singular if they refer to singular nouns
or pronouns and plural if they refer to plural nouns or pronouns.
✓	These pronouns can be either singular or plural: all, any, most, some, and none. If one of these pronouns refers to a plural (for example, all of the shows, in which all refers to shows), the pronoun is plural. If the pronoun refers to a singular (for example, most of the air, in which most refers to air), the pronoun is singular.

## Forming Plural Nouns
### 151–165 What is the correct plural form of these nouns?
 
151.	 stitch, telephone, tax

<details>

729.
**I. and II. (I. Because the air is dry, the plant needs water more often. II. In dry air, the**
plant needs water more often.) In Sentences I and II, statements about the air (Because the air is dry and in dry air) introduce the main idea (the plant needs water more often). Sentences I and II convey meaning efficiently and correctly. Sentence III (Needing water more often, the air is dry for the plant) mangles the meaning, because an introductory verb form (Needing water more often, in this sentence) attaches to the subject (air, in this sentence). Sentence III doesn’t work.

- 
152.	 dye, splash, sandal

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

152.
**dyes, splashes, sandals**
The words dye and sandal need only an s to form the plural. Splash, however, ends in sh, so you need to add es to form the plural.

</details>

- 
153.	 tomato, catch, mug

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

153.
**tomatoes, catches, mugs**
The addition of s creates the plural of mug. The word catch, which ends with ch, needs es to form the plural. So does tomato. In general, a noun ending in o forms the plural with es if the letter preceding the o is a consonant. (A consonant is any letter except a, e, i, o or u.)

</details>

- 
154.	 monkey, turkey, baby

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

154.
**monkeys, turkeys, babies**
To form the plural of a word ending in y, you add s if the y is preceded by a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). You change the y to i and add es if the y is preceded by a consonant (any letter that isn’t a vowel). Therefore, monkey and turkey need only an s, because the second-to-last letter in each word is a vowel, e. Baby, on the other hand, changes to babies, because the second-to-last letter is a consonant, b.

</details>

- 
155.	 zoo, success, edge

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

155.
**zoos, successes, edges**
To form the plural of a noun ending in o, you generally add only an s if the letter pre- ceding the final o is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). Therefore, zoos is the correct plural form. Words ending in the letter s form the plural with es, so go for successes. The word edge needs an s, and nothing more, to form the plural.

</details>

- 
156.	 child, woman, man

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

156.
**children, women, men**
These three words are irregular. None form the plural with s or es. Instead, the whole word changes! For help with irregular plurals, check your dictionary. Near the singular form you should see the abbreviation pl., which stands for plural, followed by the plural form.

</details>

- 
157.	 deer, elephant, month

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

157.
**deer, elephants, months**
Animal plurals can be tricky, so you should check your dictionary if you aren’t sure of the proper form. The plural of deer is deer! No change at all. On the other hand, you may see one elephant or two elephants while you’re on a safari. The plural of month is months.

</details>

- 
158.	 light, batch, biography

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

158.
**lights, batches, biographies**
A simple s is enough for the plural of light. Add es to batch, because it ends with ch. A consonant precedes the y in biography, so you change the y to i and add es. (A conso- nant is any letter except a, e, i, o, or u.)

</details>

- 
159.	 microphone, jelly, virus

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

159.
**microphones, jellies, viruses**
Add the letter s to form the plural of microphone. Because jelly ends in a y preceded by a consonant (any letter except a, e, i, o, or u), form the plural by changing the y to i and adding es. Add es to virus to form the plural, viruses, because the singular form ends in s.

</details>

- 
160.	 delivery, essay, wife

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

160.
**deliveries, essays, wives**
Remember the rule about words ending in y: Add s if the letter preceding the y is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). Change the y to i and add es if a consonant (any letter that isn’t a vowel) precedes the y. Using this rule, you get deliveries (because a consonant pre- cedes the y in delivery) and essays (because a vowel precedes the y in essay). The word wife has an irregular plural form, wives.

</details>

- 
161.	 Smith, Jones, O’Toole

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

161.
**Smiths, Joneses, O’Tooles**
To form the plural of names, add es to names ending in ch, sh, x, s, and z, and a simple s to everything else. Don’t form a plural of a name with an apostrophe!

</details>

- 
162.	 leaf, pitch, copy

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

162.
**leaves, pitches, copies**
The irregular plural of leaf is leaves. (Always check your dictionary if you’re unsure whether a plural is regular or irregular.) Pitch ends in ch, so you add es to form the plural. Copy ends with y preceded by a consonant (any letter that isn’t a, e, i, o, or u), so change the y to i and add es to form the plural.

</details>

- 
163.	 son-in-law, kangaroo, tooth

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

163.
**sons-in-law, kangaroos, teeth**
For a hyphenated word, zero in on the most important word and make that word plural — and nothing else! Therefore, the proper plural form is sons-in-law, because the family relationship (son) is highlighted. For words ending in o, you usually add an s if the letter preceding the o is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). Therefore, the plural of kangaroo is kangaroos. Teeth is an irregular plural. (Always check your dictionary if you’re unsure whether a plural is regular or irregular.)

</details>

- 
164.	 alumnus, mass medium, Woods

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

164.
**alumni, mass media, Woodses**
The irregular plural of alumnus, a word that comes down to us via Latin, is alumni (or, for a group composed solely of females, alumnae). Similarly, the plural of medium, another word of Latin origin, is media, unless you’re using the word to mean a size (three mediums sold this morning but no smalls) or a psychic (Jim consulted three mediums in order to communicate with his dead pet). To form the plural of my last name, Woods, add es because the name ends with an s.

</details>

- 
165.	 species, statistic, vice president

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

165.
**species, statistics, vice presidents**
Trick question here: You can have one species or two species — same spelling. Statistic takes an s to form the plural. For the compound word, vice president, add an s to the most important part, which in this case is president.
