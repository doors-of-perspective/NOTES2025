yesterday - went up nikey nook with Lily and johhny. Saved mum's life when she nearly tripped. Trina got drunk off wine - and kept asking for more, then slept in the car and was sick outside once we arrived. 

Lily and Johnny told me about **Black** Magic. Where they can guess a word without any other prompts. Clue is in the name. 

Lottie choose a word for FMP "preservation" - she told me not to tell the students. I caved and gave them blanked out _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

Then gave them a few letters throughout the day. Opal eventually guessed the word. I said One of you have guessed the word. 

Then Fin decided he knew. Whispered the word to me. Fin later says I'm very easy to sucumb to peer pressure.
