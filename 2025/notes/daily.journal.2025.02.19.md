Cardiff - drove 4 hours there and 4 hours back. 

Spent the day in the library editing my 1001 grammar questions. The recepionist fancied me. I couldn't remember the computer I was using to get the extra time - then she butted in and said which computer I was on. Smiling. I was after I smiled an said thanks to her after she signed me up for the library. Cardiff sales people are extra annoying. 

"hey you look like someone I know". I wait bitterly for his reply. "I really hansome man"... I said good one and left. 

"Hey you dropped something." I keep walking. "No really." I turn aroundd. "Your handsome smile..."

Also, weird guy with mini bincolars in the library. "are you staff?" Nope. Prior to that nearly walked into him as he didn't see me as he's looking through his bincolars. 

Read most of Depresso. Then weirdly a few things from that story line up with Trina. Acting out cause of depression. Being a white god in china (Charlotte someone said that to Trina)

Also Trina likes lying in work. Making up stories about being a forager.
