so much fun - had a lie in and was getting read to start my day when someone called me

a debt agency had clamped my car and needed Â£590 today otherwise they'd take my car away. Me and Trina only had one choice to pay. So we had to move money around and pay him. What had happened was TFL have been sending a PCN to the wrong address. Its been to court, supposedly, and I never showed up. Fines been issued then it goes to debt collector to collect. I'm going to try to appeal the notice - had to call various numbers, TFL - then some others and got this form to fill out. Need to go to Lancaster as no idea when Manchester will get back to me. 

rest of day been incredibly stressful post debt collector. Trina crying due to my incompetence - saying how she suggested we setup post office thing to get our mail, yet I said there's no point. 

then applying for jobs
