7.
**has carried**
The action in this sentence is expressed by two words, has carried, which together make one verb. The word sizzling resembles a verb but serves as a description, not the action in the sentence.

auxiliary verb "**has**" and the past participle "**carried**." The main verb is "carried," which shows the action being performed.

8.

What happened to the puppies? They were displayed, the action verb in this sentence. Did "to see" trip you up? That‚Äôs an infinitive, the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of the verb family that never functions as the verb in a sentence.

13.
**copying, stuck**
The subject of this sentence, Mike, did two actions; he was copying and he stuck his finger in the tray. The first portion of the sentence begins with a conjunction (While), which should be followed by a subject-verb statement. Two words are missing, but Mike was copying is implied, so copying counts as an official verb.

15.
**guided**
The first verb form is an introductory participle. In other words, sliding is a description of ski instructor. You know it doesn‚Äôt function as a verb because it doesn‚Äôt follow a conjunction such as while, after, before, or a similar word. The action verb that pairs with ski instructor is guided, the only verb in this sentence.

## Choosing Simple and Perfect Tense Verb Forms
### 16‚Äì55 Select the tense and form of the verb in parentheses that fits the meaning of the sentence.

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

20.
**was begging (Last week I tossed a bit of my dinner under the table because the dog was**
begging for scraps while I ate.) The verb in the first portion of the sentence, tossed, indicates an action that took place while another action occurred. The singular, past progressive tense gives a sense of an action, begging, that occurred over some time. The simple past-tense form, begged, would also work here, but the immediacy of past progressive tense is better.

22.
**trimmed (Mr. Martin trimmed the tree after he had watered it.)**
In this sentence the busy Mr. Martin is doing two things, trimming and watering, but these actions occur at different times. Standard English requires that the earlier action, the watering, be in past perfect tense (had watered). The action that occurs second is expressed in simple past tense, trimmed.

23.	 While Harry _____ (to wash) the clothes, Oliver was brushing the dog‚Äôs matted fur.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

23.
**was washing (While Harry was washing the clothes, Oliver was brushing the dog‚Äôs**
matted fur.) The second portion of the sentence indicates that the action took place in the past (was brushing). The singular, past progressive form, was washing, works nicely here, because the actions happen at the same time and only one person was involved in the washing. (The simple past tense, washed, could also work in this sentence.)

27.
**had baked (When I had baked the cookies, I placed them on the dining room table.)**
Two actions in the past show up in this sentence, the baking of the cookies and their placement on the table. Logic tells you that the baking happened before I placed the cookies somewhere other than in the oven. To move one action further in the past than another, use the past perfect tense, had baked.
