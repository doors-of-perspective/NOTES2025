# Chapter 1
## Time Travel: Identifying the Verb and Choosing the Correct Tense
In science fiction films, a character can zoom into the past or hop into the future, usually with the help of a machine resembling a giant vacuum cleaner. You time travel too, when you choose verbs for your sentences. Verbs express action or state of being in the past, present, and future. In this chapter you practice locating the verb and selecting the appropriate tense. You also tackle singular and plural forms, plugging the right one into every sentence.

## The Questions You'll Answer
Here you find sentences that allow you to sharpen your verb skills in these ways:
✓ Locating the verb(s) in a sentence
✓ Selecting simple past-, present-, or future-tense verbs to fit the meaning of a sentence
✓ Choosing progressive verb forms to indicate ongoing action
✓ Placing past perfect, present perfect, or future perfect forms where they’re needed
✓ Finding the right tense to summarize speech and discuss literary or artistic works
✓ Expressing unchangeable facts in present tense
✓ Determining whether you need a singular or plural form

## What to Watch Out For

Verb tense can be tricky, as can agreement — the matching of singular verbs to singular 
subjects and plural verbs to plural subjects. When you work through these questions, 
watch out for these issues:

✓ Zero in on the time period(s) covered in the sentence.
✓ Establish a timeline if more than one action or state of being is expressed in the 
sentence.
✓ Stay in the same tense unless the meaning of the sentence justifies a shift.
✓ Check whether the subject is singular or plural and match the verb to the subject.
✓ Ignore words that resemble verbs but function as descriptions or nouns.

# Chapter 2
## Taking a Look at Irregular, Helping, and Descriptive Verb Forms
Every year, my students are upset to discover that English has so many irregular verbs. If I were the Queen of Grammar, I’d outlaw irregular verbs. Unfortunately, without them I wouldn’t be able to fashion the first sentence of this chapter, because are would be behind bars. So would has! Like it or not, and because I’m not the *Queen of Grammar*, you and I are stuck with irregulars. Not to worry: In this chapter you practice selecting irregular verbs,changing meaning with helping verbs (should, can, may, do, does, did, and the like), and employing verb forms that can act as descriptions, which grammarians call participles and infinitives and the rest of us call “pains in the neck.”

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that develop these skills:
✓	Using irregular past-tense and participle forms correctly
✓	Selecting the proper form and tense of the irregular verbs to be and to have
✓	Adding shades of meaning with the helping verbs should, must, can, could, may, might,
and would
✓	Creating questions with helping verbs
✓	Identifying participles functioning as descriptions
✓	Choosing the best form of participles and infinitives used as descriptions
## What to watch out for
Keep these points in mind when you answer the questions in this chapter:
✓	Check whether the past-tense form or participle is regular or irregular.
✓	Choose the correct tense of irregular verbs based on the meaning of the sentence.
✓	Employ reading comprehension skills to detect the need for a helping verb expressing
obligation, possibility, condition, or ability.
✓	Rearrange word order and add helping verbs to create questions.
✓	Select present participles or infinitives as descriptions for actions in the past, present, or future.

## Handling Irregular Verbs
### 66–90 Choose the proper past, present perfect, past perfect, or future perfect form of the irregular verb in parentheses so that the verb fits the meaning of the sentence.

# Chapter 3
## One to Many: Forming Plurals of Nouns and Pronouns
According to one website, as of January, 2013, the English language was made up of - 1,019, 729.6 words. I don’t believe that anyone actually knows — or can know — how - many words are in any language. (And what on earth is 0.6 of a word?) So you can forget - about numbers when you study proper English, with one huge exception: You have to pay - attention to singular and plural forms of nouns and pronouns. In this chapter, you practice - with nouns, turning one (the singular form) into many (the plural form). You also sort - singular and plural pronouns, so that you can match them appropriately with the words - they represent.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that cover the following concepts:
✓	Forming plurals of common and proper nouns, both regular and irregular
✓	Creating plural forms of hyphenated and compound words
✓	Tackling difficult pronouns such as everything, one, either, all, some, that, which who, and so forth What to watch out for

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Most nouns form the plural by adding the letter s. For nouns ending in ch, sh, x, s, and z, add es.
✓	Nouns ending in a y change the y to i and add es if the letter preceding the y is a consonant (any letter except a, e, i, o, or u).
✓	Add s or es to the most important word in a hyphenated or compound noun.
✓	These pronouns are always singular: one, everyone, everything, everybody, no one,
nothing, nobody, someone, something, somebody, either, neither, each, other, and another.
✓	These pronouns are always plural: few, both, several, and many.
✓	Relative pronouns (that, which, who) are singular if they refer to singular nouns
or pronouns and plural if they refer to plural nouns or pronouns.
✓	These pronouns can be either singular or plural: all, any, most, some, and none. If one of these pronouns refers to a plural (for example, all of the shows, in which all refers to shows), the pronoun is plural. If the pronoun refers to a singular (for example, most of the air, in which most refers to air), the pronoun is singular.

## Forming Plural Nouns

# Chapter 4
## Identifying Subjects and Per  fecting Subject-Verb Agreement
What are you talking about, at this exact moment? That’s the subject of your - conversation. While I’m on the subject of subjects, I must mention that every sentence - has a subject — the who or what being discussed. The most important aspect of subjects - is agreement: not smiling and saying, “Yes! Yes!” but rather ensuring that a singular subject - pairs with a singular verb form and a plural subject pairs with a plural verb form. In this - chapter, you find the subject and then play matchmaker between subjects and verbs. (If you - have trouble identifying the verb, turn to Chapters 1 and 2 for extra help.)

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that cover the following concepts:
✓	Finding the subject in statements, questions, and commands
✓	Identifying compound subjects and pronouns acting as subjects
✓	Choosing the correct verb for every subject-verb pair

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	To find the subject, first locate the verb(s) in the sentence. Ask who? or what? is performing the action or is in the state of being expressed by the verb.
✓	Don’t be fooled by location. Most subjects appear before the verb, but some follow the verb. Use your reading comprehension skills to answer the who? or what? questions.
✓	Most subjects and verbs show up with descriptions attached. Ignore distracting words or phrases and concentrate on the real subject-verb pair.
✓	Verb forms used as descriptions or as nouns may resemble verbs without functioning
as the verb in the sentence. When you ask who? or what? to find the subject, be sure you’re working from the real verb.
✓	The subject in a command may be an understood, but not stated, you.
✓	Pronouns acting as subjects can be tricky. Check out Chapter 3 for help distinguishing singular and plural pronouns.

## Locating the Subject
### 196–215 Identify the subject(s) in the sentence.

# Chapter 5
## Coming to a Clear Agreement: Pairing Pronouns and Antecedents
Pronouns are like socks. They have to fit perfectly, because if they don’t, you spend the - day walking around with a lump around your toes or pulling up a too-short heel. They - also have to match: no green and blue mixing allowed! Pronouns are stand-ins for other - nouns or pronouns — their antecedents. Don’t worry about the terminology. Just be sure - to select the correct pronoun. In this chapter you find practice for every situation likely to - arise in matching pronouns to antecedents correctly and clearly.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that develop these skills:
✓	Identifying pronouns and their antecedents
✓	Pairing singular and plural pronouns with the appropriate antecedents
✓	Matching the gender of pronouns and antecedents
✓	Ensuring that the antecedent of every pronoun is clear

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	To determine whether you’re using the proper pronoun, first identify the antecedent.
✓	Singular pronouns take the place of singular nouns or other singular pronouns.
✓	Plural pronouns take the place of plural nouns or other plural pronouns.
✓	Match masculine pronouns to masculine nouns, and feminine pronouns to feminine
nouns. Use neuter pronouns for objects and ideas (it, those, and the like).
✓	Some personal pronouns refer to the speaker (I, me, we, and so forth) or to the person
addressed (you, your, for example). These pronouns have no antecedent in the sen-
tence. Other pronouns that refer to an undetermined person or thing (such as whatever
or something) may also lack an antecedent in the sentence.
✓	Pronouns must express only one meaning. If the reader can’t grasp the pronoun-
antecedent relationship, you have to reword the sentence.

## Identifying Pronouns and Their Antecedents
### 241–250 Identify each pronoun in the sentence as well as the word(s) the pronoun replaces (the antecedent). 

#### Note: More than one pronoun may refer to the same antecedent, and sometimes a pronoun has no antecedent in the sentence.

# Chapter 6
## Solving the Case (of Pronouns)
You don’t have to be a detective to know that pronouns — the part of speech that takes - the place of nouns — are important. The issue with pronouns is that their form sometimes - changes depending upon how they’re used in the sentence — a quality known as case. In - this chapter you work on all three cases — subject (also known as subjective or nominative - case), object (also known as objective case), and possessive.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that involve these concepts:
✓	Identifying pronouns as subject, object, or possessive
✓	Choosing the correct pronoun case according to the pronoun’s role in the sentence

### What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Subject pronouns act as subjects, the who or what performing the action or in the state
of being expressed in the sentence.
✓	Subject pronouns also follow linking verbs (forms of the verb to be or verbs that
express sensory information, such as to sound, to feel, and so forth).
✓	Object pronouns act as objects: direct objects, indirect objects, and objects of a preposi-
tion or verbal (a verb form not functioning as a verb). You don’t need to worry about what
type of object you have, as long as you know that the pronoun is acting as an object. An
object answers the questions whom? or what? after a verb, preposition, or verb form.
✓	Possessive pronouns express ownership. When you say my book or our vacation, my
and our are possessive pronouns.
✓	Some possessive pronouns function as subjects, objects, or other roles commonly
played by nouns. In that book is mine, mine is a possessive pronoun because it
expresses ownership, even though in this sentence it’s acting as a subject complement.
✓	You may run across a verb form ending in -ing that acts as a noun — a gerund, in
English-teacher terminology. The pronoun preceding it is possessive. For example, in
this sentence the possessive pronoun my precedes the gerund swimming: The coach
doesn’t like my swimming, but he can’t stop me!
✓	Don’t confuse possessive pronouns with contractions — shortened forms of other words.
It’s means “it is,” and its is a possessive pronoun. No possessive pronoun has an apostrophe.

## Sorting Subject, Object, and Possessive Pronouns
### 271–285 Identify the underlined pronouns as subject (S), object (O), or possessive (P) pronouns.

# Chapter 7
## Forming Complete Sentences
In court, witnesses must swear to tell “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the - truth.” In grammar, you have to write “the sentence, the whole sentence, and nothing but - the sentence.” In other words, complete sentences rule — not fragments (partial or incom- - plete sentences) or run-ons (two or more ideas improperly thrown together). In this chapter - you practice identifying and creating complete and grammatically correct statements and - questions.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that involve these skills:
✓	Recognizing whether a sentence is complete or incomplete
✓	Joining two or more ideas correctly
✓	Editing fragments and run-ons to create complete sentences

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Every sentence must express a complete thought.
✓	Be sure the sentence has a matching subject-verb pair.
✓	All sentences need endmarks — periods for statements, question marks for questions,
and exclamation points for exclamations.
✓	Don’t assume that short sentences are incomplete and long sentences are complete.
Meaning, not length, is your guide.
✓	Semicolons (;) and conjunctions such as and, but, or, nor, for, since, because, where, when,
and others link one clause (a grammatical unit containing a subject-verb pair) to another.
✓	Relative pronouns — who, whoever, whom, whomever, that, and which — relate one
idea to another, usually by replacing a noun. For example, in this sentence the relative
pronoun that replaces book: The book that I bought is very heavy.
✓	Adverbs such as however, consequently, therefore, then, also, nevertheless, and others
may not link one complete sentence to another. Use these words to add meaning, but
be sure that you use a semicolon or a conjunction between the sentences.

## Recognising Complete Sentences

# Chapter 8 !
## Moving Beyond the Basics: Adding Descriptions
A complete sentence (see Chapter 7) can be as short as two words: Marjorie raps, for
example. Life would be very boring, though, if you relied only on subjects and verbs
to get your meaning across. Add in some adjectives and adverbs — the descriptive parts of
speech — and your listener or reader perks up. These “extras” give us Marjorie raps often or
Marjorie raps superfast or Little Marjorie raps every single day. In this chapter you practice
with short descriptions — one-word or slightly longer expressions that attach to nouns,
pronouns, verbs, and other adjectives and adverbs.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions in these areas:
✓	Identifying adjectives and adverbs
✓	Selecting the appropriate adjective or adverb for a particular situation
✓	Knowing when to use a or an
✓	Inserting hyphens in compound descriptions. 

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Adjectives describe nouns and pronouns, telling you how many, which one, how much,
or what kind of thing or person you’re talking about.
✓	Adverbs describe verbs, telling you how, when, where, why, or under what conditions
an action or state of being occurs.
✓	Adverbs also describe adjectives and other adverbs, expressing the intensity or degree
of the quality the adverb describes.
✓	The article an precedes a word beginning with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, or u).
A precedes a word beginning with a consonant sound (any letter except the
vowels listed in the preceding sentence).
✓	If two or more words function as one description, you generally hyphenate them, as in
second-place finish, green-and-yellow hat, hard-working waiter, and so forth.

## Distinguishing Between Adjectives and Adverbs
### 362–373 Identify the underlined words (in order) as adjectives (ADJ), adverbs (ADV), or neither (N).

# Chapter 9
# Taking the Long View: Descriptive Phrases and Clauses

As you text or tweet, short descriptions seem like a good idea. (Chapter 8 provides practice with almost everything you need to know about these one- or two-word descriptions, also known as adjectives and adverbs.) Longer descriptive elements — phrases and clauses — may not make it into a tweet, but they’re valuable nonetheless. In this chapter you have a chance to show that you know where to place descriptions — mostly the long form, plus a couple of tricky short descriptions — so that they express your intended meaning.


## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these concepts:

✓	Recognizing the word or words described by phrases and clauses
✓	Placing phrases and clauses so that they are clear and describe the appropriate word

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Prepositional phrases may describe nouns or pronouns (adjective phrases) or verbs
(adverb phrases).
✓	Infinitives and participles may also act as descriptions. Infinitives (to + verb, such as
to meet, to greet, to sleep) may describe nouns, pronouns, or verbs. Participles (the
part of a verb you use with has, have, or had, such as given, driving, and the like) may
describe nouns or pronouns.
✓	Clauses (units of a sentence that contain a subject-verb pair) may describe nouns,
pronouns, or verbs.
✓	To find any sort of adjective, ask these questions: How many? Which one? What kind? To
locate an adverb, ask the following: How? When? Where? Why? Under what conditions?
✓	Every description, no matter how long or short, must be placed as near as possible
to the word it describes. Only, just, almost, and nearly must be placed right before the
word or words they apply to, not earlier in the sentence.
✓	Steer clear of vague descriptions that may describe one or more words in the sentence.
Your meaning must be clear.
✓	When a verbal phrase begins a sentence, it must describe the subject of the sentence.

# Chapter 10
## For Better or Worse: Forming Correct Comparisons
While everyone else is dabbing away tears or snapping photos, do you find yourself wondering why wedding vows pledge “for better or worse” instead of “for more good or more bad”? If so, this chapter is for you. Here, you’re challenged to create comparisons of all types — with one word or many. You also identify and correct vague, illogical, or impossible comparisons.

The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that involve the following tasks:
✓	Choosing the correct word(s) to compare two elements (the comparative form, such as
nicer) or three or more elements (the superlative form, such as nicest)
✓	Inserting more, most, less, and least properly
✓	Dealing with irregular comparisons — good, better, best and bad, worse, worst
✓	Identifying words that can’t be compared
✓	Avoiding incomplete and illogical comparisons

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Short words often form positive comparisons by adding -er or -est to the base word,
and if the base word ends in y, you generally change the y to i before adding -er or -est.
✓	Don’t double up: If you add -er or -est, don’t use more or most too.
✓	Use the comparative (-er or more, less) when comparing two elements and the superla-
tive (-est or most, least) when comparing three or more elements.
✓	Absolutes — perfect, unique, and similar concepts — can’t be compared.
✓	Good, bad, well, many, and much are irregular.
✓	All comparisons must be complete and clear.
✓	Use other or else when comparing someone or something to the group that includes
the person or thing being compared.

## Creating Comparative and Superlative Forms

# Chapter 11
## Avoiding Capital Punishment: Placing Capital Letters Properly
Would you like to stay out of Grammar Jail? If so, place your capital letters where
they’re needed and nowhere else. Sounds easy, right? It is — mostly. Just know the
rules and follow them. Then the Grammar Cops won’t come after you.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these questions:
✓	Deciding when to capitalize people’s names and titles, relationships, and ethnicity
✓	Choosing capitals or lowercase letters for dates, seasons, geographical names, and
regions
✓	Selecting capitals for the titles of literary and scientific works and historical eras or
events
✓	Placing capitals in references to school years and courses
✓	Following the rules for capital letters in quotations

## What to Watch out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Proper names and the personal pronoun I are capitalized, as is a title used as a name or
preceding the name of the person holding that title.
✓	Seasons of the year aren’t capitalized, but the names of months and days are.
✓	The proper names of countries, regions, and geographical features are capitalized.
Generic geographical references are in lowercase.
✓	The first letter of a sentence, title, or subtitle is always capitalized. In headline style,
nouns, verbs, and other important words in titles are capitalized; less important words
aren’t. Titles of scientific works generally follow sentence style, capitalizing only the
first word of the title and subtitle, as well as any proper names.
✓	References to God are customarily capitalized.
✓	School years are in lowercase. Subject areas, except for languages or references to
countries, aren’t capitalized. The names of courses are capitalized in headline style.
✓	The first word of a quotation that is connected to a speaker tag (he said, I stated, and so
forth) is capitalized. Quotations inserted into a sentence without a speaker tag begin
with a lowercase letter, unless the first word is a proper name or the pronoun 

I.
 The
second half of an interrupted quotation begins with a lowercase letter.

# Chapter 12
## Exercising Comma Sense: Placing Commas Correctly
A tiny curved line, the comma has more power than most elected officials. It can make your meaning clear or change the meaning of a sentence entirely. Placing commas where they belong isn’t rocket science, but it does require you to notice every detail. In this chapter you practice paying attention to commas and exercising “comma sense.” The Questions You’ll Work On

In this chapter, you work on questions that exercise the following skills:
✓	Punctuating lists with commas and inserting semicolons where needed
✓	Differentiating between essential and nonessential information by inserting commas
✓	Using commas to set off introductory elements and interruptions in the sentence
✓	Creating direct address with commas
✓	Separating clauses with commas and conjunctions

## What to Watch out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Elements of a list are generally separated by commas. The comma before and is
optional, though most people include it.
✓	If items in a list contain commas, use semicolons to separate the items.
✓	Set off nonessential descriptions from the rest of the sentence using commas. Essential
information is not set off by commas.
✓	Nonessential clauses (subject-verb statements) often begin with which. Essential
clauses often begin with that.
✓	Commas set off words in a sentence that interrupt the flow of meaning (direct address,
exclamations, and the like).
✓	When you join one complete sentence to another with a conjunction (and, or, but, for, yet, nor), place a comma before the conjunction.

## Commas in Lists
### 542–556 Punctuate the list by adding commas and semicolons as needed. Note: Some optional commas already appear in the lists.

# Chapter 13
## Little Things That Mean A Lot: Apostrophes and Quotation Marks
A postrophes and quotation marks cause much confusion, but these tiny bits of ink serve a purpose. Apostrophes indicate ownership and omitted letters or numbers. Quotation marks identify words from someone other than the writer. In this chapter you answer questions about the proper placement of apostrophes and quotation marks.

The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions in the following areas:
✓	Placing apostrophes to show ownership by one or more people
✓	Shortening words or numbers with apostrophes
✓	Using apostrophes with expressions of time and money
✓	Distinguishing between quoted and paraphrased material
✓	Situating periods, commas, and other punctuation marks in quoted material, citations,
and titles

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Don’t use an apostrophe to create a plural. (Exceptions to this rule exist, but they’re
not in common use.)
✓	To create a possessive, singular noun, add ’s. To create a possessive, regular plural, add
an apostrophe after the s. To create the possessive form of an irregular plural, add ’s.
✓	In contractions, replace omitted words or numbers with an apostrophe. (A few irregular
contractions, such as won’t for will not, don’t follow this rule.)
✓	Always surround quoted material and titles of short works (poems, short stories, and
the like) with quotation marks.
✓	In Standard American English, single quotation marks appear only when one quotation
nests inside another quotation. Place periods and commas before the closing
quotation mark. Place semicolons and colons after the closing quotation mark.
✓	If you’re quoting a question, the question mark precedes the closing quotation mark.
If the sentence is a question but the quotation isn’t, place the question mark after the
closing quotation mark. Follow the same pattern for exclamation points — before
the closing quotation mark if the quoted words are an exclamation and after the
closing quotation mark if the sentence, but not the quotation, is an exclamation.

# Chapter 14
## Not Just for Railroad Tracks: Parallelism
Picture railroad tracks as a train chugs along. What happens if the tracks aren’t perfectly parallel? Derailment and disaster! The damage to your sentence may not be as obvious, but it occurs, nevertheless, if your sentence isn’t parallel. Watch out when you write lists, comparisons, and any sentences with two or more matched elements (sub- jects, verbs, clauses, and so forth); they’re only parallel if everything performing the same function has the same grammatical identity — perhaps all infinitives or all gerunds or all clauses. Don’t worry about the grammar terms. Just listen to the voice inside your head reading your words. If a sentence or list sounds balanced, it’s probably parallel. In this chap- ter you answer questions on all sorts of parallel situations.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these types of questions:
✓	Ensuring that lists are parallel
✓	Keeping elements parallel when they’re joined by paired conjunctions (either/or,
­neither/nor, both/and, not only/but also)
✓	Writing parallel comparisons with rather/than, as much as, more/than, and other
­connectors
✓	Avoiding unnecessary shifts in verb tense, person, and active/passive voice

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	When you’re dealing with a pair of conjunctions, check that the same grammatical
structure follows each half of the conjunction pair. In other words, if a subject-verb pair
follows either, a subject-verb pair must follow or.
✓	Check all comparisons to be sure that the items compared have the same grammatical
structure. You can compare a description to a description or a verb to a verb, but not a
verb to a description.
✓	Avoid switching from active (I wrote a speech) to passive voice (the speech was read by me).
✓	Unless the meaning of the sentence requires a change in tense, be consistent.
✓	Don’t change from one person (say, third person, as in they study) to another (such as
the second-person statement you learn) unless you have a good reason to do so.

# Chapter 15
## Slimming Down: Cutting Repetition and Wordiness
Do your sentences need to go on a diet? Are they chubby around the middle, with repetitive or wordy elements? If so, consider this chapter your path to trimmer, more powerful expression.

## The Questions You’ll Work On

In this chapter, you work on these concepts:
✓	Identifying synonyms or other repetitious expressions
✓	Writing concisely by eliminating unnecessary words

## What to Watch Out For. 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Many words are close in meaning. Tense, for example, refers to how you feel when your
muscles clench as tightly as possible. Nervous, on the other hand, describes the jitters
that zing through your nervous system. Chances are you don’t need both tense and
nervous to describe one mood. Look for the right word, the one that truly fits the
situation in your sentence.
✓	Shorter isn’t always better, but nobody likes to waste time. Look for extra words:
doubled descriptions, unnecessary explanations, and overly complicated sentence
structure. When you find these issues, revise the sentence.


## Cutting Repetitive Words and Phrases from Sentences
### 697–706 What words, if any, are repetitive in the sentence? Note: For the purpose of this exercise, assume that words close in meaning, but not identical, are unnecessary.

# Chapter 16
You can — and should — develop a sense of style when you’re writing. Style comes from many factors. In this chapter you work on combining ideas in interesting, fluid ways and experimenting with sentence patterns.bining ideas in interesting, fluid ways
and experimenting with sentence patterns.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions targeting the following:
✓	Inserting information into basic sentences with clauses and phrases
✓	Ensuring that sentences express the intended meaning
✓	Punctuating complicated sentences correctly
✓	Varying the normal subject-verb-complement pattern of a sentence
✓	Experimenting with sentence structure

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Clauses (subject-verb statements) beginning with who, whom, whose, which, or that
usually insert descriptions of nouns or pronouns. Other types of clauses describe
verbs, giving information about time, place, method, or reasons.
✓	Some clauses play crucial roles inside other clauses, acting as subjects or objects.
These clauses often begin with whoever, whomever, or that.
✓	Placed properly, verbals — words that resemble verbs but function as nouns, adjec-
tives, or adverbs — make your writing flow more smoothly. Consider using infinitives
(to + a verb), gerunds (the -ing form of a verb acting as a noun), and participles (a verb
form that may function as an adjective) to spice up your sentences.
✓	When you work with participles and infinitives, check the tense. The present
form places the action or the state of being at the same time as the verb in
the sentence. The past tense places the action or state of being prior to what
the main verb of the sentence expresses.
✓	When you add clauses or phrases, take care that your sentence is complete
(no fragments!) and properly punctuated (no run-ons!).
✓	Essential, identifying information isn’t set off from the rest of the sentence
by commas. Extra information is surrounded by commas.
✓	When a sentence begins with a verbal, the subject of the sentence must
be the one performing the action or in the state of being expressed by the
verbal.
✓	Mature writers vary sentence length and pattern.

# Chapter 17
## Spotlighting Verbs: Voice and Mood
How’s your voice? I’m not asking whether you sing in the shower. Instead, I’m inquiring about your knowledge of active and passive verbs (qualities known as voice in the grammar world). In this chapter you also get in touch with mood — specifically, when and how to use a verb in subjunctive mood. Sounds complicated, right? It isn’t. Those important-sounding grammar terms mask some very simple principles: active verb forms are nearly always better than passive, and if/then statements require special attention. In this chapter you find practice questions on the voice and mood of verbs.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these types of questions:
✓	Distinguishing between active and passive verb forms
✓	Changing passive verbs to active where appropriate
✓	Selecting the proper verb forms for if/then statements

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	When a sentence has a verb in active voice, the subject performs the action or is in the
state of being expressed by the verb, as in Pete applied for a position with the Peace Corps.
✓	With a passive-voice verb, the subject receives the action, as in The job notice was
posted on the bulletin board.
✓	In general, use passive voice only when an active-voice sentence is awkward or
impossible (when you don’t know who performed the action, for example).
✓	If you discuss a situation that isn’t true, use subjunctive mood for the if statement and
the conditional helping verb would for the other portion of the sentence. Were creates
a subjunctive statement for being verbs; had does the same thing for action verbs.
✓	If you’re talking about a real possibility, don’t use subjunctive in an if/then statement.
✓	The if statement never includes the helping verb would.
✓	Sometimes in an if/then statement, the if is implied. You still need a subjunctive verb in
the clause that sets up the hypothetical situation. Here’s an example, with the subjunctive
verb underlined: Had Natalia understood Italian, she would have scolded the waiter. The
hypothetical statement may also begin with as if or as though.


## Identifying Active an Passive Verb Forms
### 767–774 Identify active verb forms (AV) and passive verb forms (PV). Note: In addition to words functioning as verbs, label descriptive verb forms (participles) as active (AV) or passive (PV).

# Chapter 18
## Dealing with Electronic Media
One of the best educated people I know recently said, “Grammar in e-mail? You’re kid- ding! I’ve never put a comma in an e-mail. I don’t use them in presentations either.” Well, I do. I put commas in text messages too, as well as in instant messages. I don’t tweet, but if I did, I’d probably throw in a couple of commas there also. Granted, I’m stricter than normal people (in other words, nongrammarians). Plus, I have to admit that communica- tion media change so rapidly that the rules for writing with them have to be fluid also. Most people feel free to drop at least some conventions of grammar when they pull out a smartphone or a tablet or project a presentation slide. But before you toss all the rules, you should know today’s commonly accepted standards for writing e-mails, texts, and instant messages. Furthermore, you should know how to write a list with bullet points — the sort you see on PowerPoint, Prezi, or Keynote presentation slides — without inflicting a fatal wound on Standard English. For help with these skills, read on.

## The Questions You’ll Work On

In this chapter, you work on questions testing these skills:
✓	Capitalizing titles and bullet points in presentation slides and subject lines
✓	Punctuating bulleted lists, e-mails, texts, and instant messages
✓	Creating parallel bulleted lists
✓	Communicating clearly and achieving the right degree of formality in electronic media

## What to Watch out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	The title of a presentation slide, if it has one, follows the headline style of capitaliza-
tion. Subject lines of e-mails usually do so also, though you have more leeway there.
✓	All the items on a bullet-point list should be parallel. In other words, they should have
the same grammatical identity.
114
✓	If the bulleted list begins with an introductory sentence, use a colon if the sentence is
complete or if the bullet points aren’t part of the introductory statement. Don’t place
any punctuation after an introductory statement that ends with a linking verb (any
form of to be) or if the bullet points combine with the introductory statement to form a
complete sentence.
✓	Commonly used (and mutually understood) abbreviations are fine in instant messages
and texts. Breaking some rules of capitalization and punctuation is generally accepted
in these short forms, as long as the meaning is clear. Words may also be omitted or
implied, unless they are necessary for clarity.
✓	When writing to someone who outranks you (a supervisor, a teacher, an elderly rela-
tive), follow the rules of Standard English.

## Presentation Slides

# Chapter 19
## Choosing Language to Suit Your Audienc
When people find out that I write grammar books, some go into “gotcha” mode. They scrutinize everything I say, hoping to catch a mistake. And they do! In fact, they should. Why? Because formal, totally proper English isn’t appropriate for all situations. When you’re at a party, you probably employ what I call “conversational English” — a less formal version of the language that features shortened or dropped words, incomplete sentences, and similar elements. Conversational English makes you more approachable. One level down is even less formal, what I call “friendspeak.” On this level you make some mistakes on purpose, using slang and throwing in me instead of I or who instead of whom. Of course, in school or on the job, proper English is generally the goal. In this chapter you practice moving from level to level of correctness, depending upon the situation you’re in. These questions check your ability to adapt your oral or ­written expression as needed.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that test these skills:
✓	Identifying levels of formality
✓	Suiting your words to a particular situation

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	If you’re speaking or writing to someone with more power than you, formal English is
best. However, no one likes to hear stiff, old-fashioned, or flowery expressions. Even in
formal English, strive for direct and clear expression.
✓	When communicating with peers, let the relationship and situation guide you. A friend
in the office may be comfortable with conversational English while you’re gossiping at
the coffee machine but not when you’re writing a business memo. On Friday night away
from the office, friends may “kick off their grammar shoes” and break every rule in the
book.
122
✓	Slang works only when everyone who’s supposed to be part of the conver-
sation understands what you’re saying. By its nature, slang excludes some
people, usually on purpose. Teenagers invent terms all the time specifically to
mystify adults — and succeed beautifully!
✓	Jargon — specialized terms, abbreviations, and acronyms — is fine only if the
intended audience comprehends. Acronyms are formed from the first letter of
each word in a name (NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for example).
✓	Electronic communication (text or instant messages, blogs, e-mails) sometimes
relax the usual grammar rules, but even there, take care if you’re writing to
someone of higher status in a given situation.

## Identifying Levels of Formality
### 827–836 Place these expressions in order of formality, moving from the most formal to the least. **Note**: Two expressions may “tie.” For example, your answer may be **1 and 2, 3**. In that answer, the first and second statements have the same level of formality, and the third statement is less formal than the first two.

827.	 1.
You just don’t get it.
2.
You do not comprehend the situation.
3.
You don’t understand what happened.

# Chapter 20
## Tricky Word Traps
T he road to proper English is full of potholes, including words with vastly different mean- ings that resemble each other in spelling or sound and words that many people use interchangeably — and incorrectly. In this chapter you perfect your ability to tell these “twins” apart and smooth the highway to better speech and writing. 

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these types of questions:
✓	Distinguishing between words such as passed and past that sound nearly the same
✓	Using almost-look-alikes such as farther and further correctly
✓	Selecting possessives and contractions (their and they’re, its and it’s) as needed
✓	Placing commonly misused words (if and whether, like and as) in their proper context

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Accept means “to agree or to take”; except means “other than.” Related forms are
­acceptance and exception.
✓	In common usage, affect is a verb meaning “to influence,” and effect is a noun meaning
“a result.” Effect is sometimes used as a verb meaning “to bring about,” as in to effect
change.
✓	Farther measures distance; further means “additional.”
✓	As a noun, principal is the head of a school or one of the most important people in a
given situation; as an adjective it also means “most important.” A principle is a “rule or
standard.”
✓	Stationary refers to something that’s fixed in one place; stationery is school or office
supplies, especially paper and envelopes.
✓	To compliment is “to praise,” and to complement is “to complete, to bring to a better
level.” Related forms are complimentary (which may mean either “praising” or “free”)
and complementary.
128
✓	A historic event is an important moment in history, the record or study of the
past. Historical refers to anything related to the past. The noun past refers to
everything up until the present moment; past as an adverb means “in front
of” or “by.” Passed is a verb meaning “moved by or along” in time or space.
✓	A capitol is a building where government meets; the capital is the city where
the government is located. Capital also refers to money for investing and
may, as an adjective, mean “chief, most important.”
✓	There refers to a place, their shows possession, and they’re means “they are.”
✓	To is a preposition, two is a number, and too means “also” or “excessive.”
✓	Since refers to time, and because to a reason. If begins a statement about a
condition or possibility, and whether presents two alternatives (whether or
not).
✓	Unique means “one of a kind” and is an absolute term. Unusual or rare are
better words when something is odd, but not unique.
✓	Disinterested means “fair and impartial,” and uninterested means
“not interested.”
✓	Like may be a verb (meaning “to appreciate or enjoy”) or a preposition. It
may not introduce a subject-verb statement; to introduce subject-verb pairs,
use as or as though.
✓	Try and works only when you’re discussing two actions; otherwise, use try to.
✓	You emigrate when you leave a country and immigrate when you enter a
country. Related words are emigrant, emigration, immigrant, and immigration.
✓	A number of means “some,” but the number usually refers to a specific
­quantity.
✓	When you hint at something, you imply; when you figure out what the hint
means, you infer.
✓	Kind of or sort of means “type of.” Don’t use these expressions as substitutes
for rather, somewhat, or a bit.

# Chapter 21
## Seeing Double: Confusing Word Pairs
You can’t always trust your eyes and ears to help you select the right word or phrase. Sometimes a single space or letter changes the meaning altogether. That word, which means “completely,” proves my point because it resembles all together, which refers to a group acting “in unison.” To make your life even more difficult, some expressions that you see everywhere, such as alot and could of, don’t exist in Standard English. In this chapter you sharpen your English skills by concentrating on spacing and spelling, so that your word choices will always be correct.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these skills:
✓	Selecting the proper word or phrase for a particular context
✓	Eliminating words that aren’t correct in Standard English

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Altogether means “completely”; all together means “in unison” or “gathered in the same
place.”
✓	Some time refers to a period of time; sometime means “at some point in the future”;
sometimes means “occasionally.” Someday and anytime are adverbs referring to an
unspecified time in the future. Some day is a noun (day) with a description (some). It
means “an unnamed day”; any time (also a noun + a description) means “any amount of
time.” Someplace is an adverb meaning “somewhere”; some place is a noun-description
combo that refers to an unspecified location.
✓	Every day means “each day”; everyday means “ordinary or common.”
✓	Already means “so soon” or “by this time”; all ready means “completely prepared.”
✓	These words, though common, aren’t Standard English expressions: alright, alot, might
of, could of, would of, should of, might could, eachother, hisself, theyselves, theirselves,
anywheres, nowheres, and etc., had of, had ought, this here, that there.

# Chapter 22
## Steering Clear of Incorrect Expressions
I’m the first to admit that some grammar rules make no sense. When my students ask why they have to place a comma in a certain spot or change a word, sometimes my only answer is because you do. End of story! Occasionally, though, grammar rests on a logical framework. In this chapter you tackle a few rules in that category, as well as a couple that represent nothing more than tradition.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that focus on the following skills:
✓	Selecting expressions that are correct in Standard English
✓	Avoiding double negatives
✓	Distinguishing between the verbs rise and raise, sit and set, and lie and lay

## Watch to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Different than isn’t generally accepted in formal usage. Use different from, followed by a noun.
✓	The reason is because is incorrect in Standard English. Use the reason is that or simply
state the reason, introduced by because.
✓	Irregardless and being that aren’t Standard English expressions. Try regardless, despite,
or because.
✓	In some languages, the more negatives you include, the more emphatically you’re deny-
ing the point. In English, though, double negatives are a no-no because the two nega-
tives equal a positive statement. Avoid can’t hardly, can’t scarcely, can’t help but, and
can’t but. Go for can hardly, can scarcely, can’t help (plus the -ing form of a verb, as in
can’t help snooping), and can only.
✓	The English language distinguishes between what you measure (sugar, for example, or
loyalty) and what you count (shoes or years, perhaps). Measuring words include amount,
less, little, and much. To count, select number of, fewer, few, and many. A few words
(more, all, any, no, and some) work for both measuring and counting. Between and among
are prepositions; use between when you have two people or things (between home and
school) and among when you have more than two (among 50 musicians).
140
✓	Rise means “to get up, to lift oneself.” Use raise when you’re lifting something (or some-
one!) else. Rise is an irregular verb: rise, rose, rising, risen. Raise is regular: raise, raising,
raised.
✓	Sit is what you do when you place yourself in a chair or another surface. Set means
“to place,” and it refers to an action you perform on something else. Sit is irregular: sit,
­sitting, sat. Set is also irregular: set, setting, set.
✓	Lie means “to rest or recline.” Lay is “to place, to put down.” These verbs are devilish
because the past tense of lie is lay. The past participle is lain. The past tense of lay is
laid, which is also the past participle.


## Avoiding Double Negatives and Other Errors
### 952–971 How should the underlined words be changed, if at all, to create a correct sentence?
