Create a goal for the character and have the story unfold to make the hero deal with their deep weakness.
If you do that the plot comes from the deep source of the character.
Character Motivation and Action.
Intention and Motivation
We want them to succeed but there has to be a struggle

And put them in situations where they have to make a choice

TD example: Marty‚Äôs anger causes him to kill the killer and thus all the information he had, which could have lead them to the real killer.
This satisfies the need for plot, without betraying the character.
This ability to disguise plot progression as organic development of a character's motivations really is the mark of a great writer and a great story.


Dramatic situations 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations 

‚ÄúFilm is a visual medium. You must find ways to reveal your 
character's conflicts visually. You cannot reveal what you don't know‚Äù

Who is your main character? 

Who is your story about?

Phrase your creative questions to begin with the word what, not why. What implies a specific response; if you ask yourself a question beginning with the word why, you can get many different answers, and they may all be correct. So try to phrase any questions using the word what: What causes my character to react in this manner?

What is the purpose of this scene? It may take a while to phrase the question, and the answer may not appear as soon as you would like it to, but trust the process; it's bigger than you are. That's why I call writing a character biography creative research.

Think about conflicts; he may want one thing, she another. It may be as important as whether or not to have children, or simply that he likes sporting events and she likes the theater.
