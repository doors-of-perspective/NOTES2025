future perfect tense

# See in Action

Q26 
will have gobbled (By the time George gets home, Maria will have gobbled all the cookies, and George hates all the other snacks.) The sentence includes a deadline — the time George gets home — and something that happens before the deadline — Maria’s snack attack. The future perfect tense, will have gobbled, is made for just such a situation.
