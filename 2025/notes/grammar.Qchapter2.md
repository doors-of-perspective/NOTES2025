# Chapter 2
## Taking a Look at Irregular, Helping, and Descriptive Verb Forms
Every year, my students are upset to discover that English has so many irregular verbs. If I were the Queen of Grammar, I’d outlaw irregular verbs. Unfortunately, without them I wouldn’t be able to fashion the first sentence of this chapter, because are would be behind bars. So would has! Like it or not, and because I’m not the *Queen of Grammar*, you and I are stuck with irregulars. Not to worry: In this chapter you practice selecting irregular verbs,changing meaning with helping verbs (should, can, may, do, does, did, and the like), and employing verb forms that can act as descriptions, which grammarians call participles and infinitives and the rest of us call “pains in the neck.”

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that develop these skills:
✓	Using irregular past-tense and participle forms correctly
✓	Selecting the proper form and tense of the irregular verbs to be and to have
✓	Adding shades of meaning with the helping verbs should, must, can, could, may, might,
and would
✓	Creating questions with helping verbs
✓	Identifying participles functioning as descriptions
✓	Choosing the best form of participles and infinitives used as descriptions
## What to watch out for
Keep these points in mind when you answer the questions in this chapter:
✓	Check whether the past-tense form or participle is regular or irregular.
✓	Choose the correct tense of irregular verbs based on the meaning of the sentence.
✓	Employ reading comprehension skills to detect the need for a helping verb expressing
obligation, possibility, condition, or ability.
✓	Rearrange word order and add helping verbs to create questions.
✓	Select present participles or infinitives as descriptions for actions in the past, present, or future.

## Handling Irregular Verbs
### 66–90 Choose the proper past, present perfect, past perfect, or future perfect form of the irregular verb in parentheses so that the verb fits the meaning of the sentence.

66.	 Joe _____ (to catch) the ball as it reached the top of the outfield fence.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

66.
**caught (Joe caught the ball as it reached the top of the outfield fence.)**
The action takes place in the past, because the ball reached (past tense) the fence when Joe caught it. The irregular past-tense form of to catch is caught.

67.	 The car was cruising along the highway smoothly until it _____ (to hit) a huge bump.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

67.
**hit (The car was cruising along the highway smoothly until it hit a huge bump.)**
The action is in the past, as the first verb, was cruising, tells you. The second verb should be in the past also, but because hitting a bump isn’t an event stretching over a time period, as cruising is, the simple past tense is best. Hit is the irregular past-tense form of to hit.

- 
68.	 Dorothy and the baby _____ (to sleep) for two hours when they returned from a visit to Grandma.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

68.
**slept (Dorothy and the baby slept for two hours when they returned from a visit to**
Grandma.) You need the simple past tense for the first part of this sentence, in order to match the past-tense verb (returned) in the second part of the sentence. The irregular past-tense form of to sleep is slept.

</details>

- 
69.	 At the end of the trial the judge _____ (to rise) from her chair and left the courtroom.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

69.
**rose (At the end of the trial the judge rose from her chair and left the courtroom.)**
The sentence talks about the past (left), so you need a past-tense verb for the blank. The irregular past-tense form of to rise is rose.

</details>

- 
70.	 Last week the Yankees _____ (to beat) their fiercest rivals.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

70.
**beat (Last week the Yankees beat their fiercest rivals.)**
The irregular past-tense form of to beat is beat. You know you need past tense because the sentence refers to last week.

</details>

- 
71.	 From 2010 through 2011, the confused clerk _____ (to put) all the forms in the wrong file cabinet.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

71.
**put (From 2010 through 2011, the confused clerk put all the forms in the wrong file**
cabinet.) The time range (2010 through 2011) tells you that you’re in the past. The irregular past- tense form of to put is put.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

72.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

74.
**swam (I didn’t know that you swam in the deep water last summer; I thought you were less**
advanced in your swimming skills.) The irregular past-tense form of to swim is swam. The words last summer indicate that you need past tense in this sentence.

</details>

75.	 Nelson wouldn’t _____ (to get) sick if he had washed his hands more frequently.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

75.
**have gotten (Nelson wouldn’t have gotten sick if he had washed his hands more**
frequently.) The irregular past participle of to get is gotten, not got, in American usage. Therefore, have gotten is correct here.

</details>

- 
76.	 The bully approached, but because my uncle _____ (to teach) me how to handle difficult people, I wasn’t afraid.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

76.
**had taught (The bully approached, but because my uncle had taught me how to handle**
difficult people, I wasn’t afraid.) The sentence covers two time periods in the past — when the uncle taught and when the bully approached. The teaching takes place before the approaching, so the earlier action should be expressed in past perfect tense. The irregular past perfect form of to teach is had taught.

</details>

- 
77.	 The doctor _____ (to do) everything in his power; now Allison must wait for the medicine to take effect.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

77.
**has done (The doctor has done everything in his power; now Allison must wait for the**
medicine to take effect.) The doctor acted and now Allison is waiting, so past and present are connected in this sentence. The present perfect tense does the job here. The irregular present perfect form of to do is has done. The simple past tense, did, is also acceptable.

</details>

- 
78.	 Miriam _____ (to let) the dog out for a few minutes, but she will call him inside soon.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

78.
**let (Miriam let the dog out for a few minutes, but she will call him inside soon.)**
Miriam’s action occurred already, so past tense is appropriate for this sentence. The irregular past-tense form of to let is let.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

80.
**began (“Who began the fight, you or your brother?” asked Mother as she separated her**
battling children.) The irregular past-tense form of to begin is began. The mother asked, so past tense makes sense. (Also, you can’t ask about the beginning of a fight until it has begun!)

</details>

81.	 After you _____ (to send) the letter, shred the scrap copies.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

81.
**have sent (After you have sent the letter, shred the scrap copies.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

82.
**froze (At first the rain was simply annoying, but when it froze, the streets became very**
slippery and many pedestrians fell.) Three events take place more or less at the same time — the change from water to ice, the formation of slippery sidewalks, and the crash landing of many pedestrians. Because these events are simultaneous, the irregular past-tense form, froze, is what you want here.

</details>

83.	 Albert _____ (to tear) his shirt when he crawled through the obstacle course.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

83.
**tore (Albert tore his shirt when he crawled through the obstacle course.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

84.
**knew (“I knew it!” exclaimed the detective as the murderer confessed.)**
The detective’s exclamation refers to one action in the past, not to a series of actions that must be put in order, a situation that requires the use of the past perfect tense. The simple past-tense form, knew, does the job here.

</details>

- 
85.	 When she attempted to pay for her coffee, Lee discovered that she _____ (to lose) all her coins because of a small hole in her pocket.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

85.
**had lost (When she attempted to pay for her coffee, Lee discovered that she had lost all**
her coins because of a small hole in her pocket.) The sentence mentions several events in the past. Attempting to pay for the coffee and discovering the hole happen more or less at the same time, but losing the coins occurs earlier. The earlier action is expressed with the past perfect tense, had lost. The other actions (attempted, discovered) are in simple past tense.

</details>

- 
86.	 By midnight Angie _____ (to sing) that aria enough times to set a world record.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

86.
**will have sung (By midnight Angie will have sung that aria enough times to set a world**
record.) The sentence contains a deadline (by midnight) and an action that will take place before the deadline (the singing). The future perfect tense, will have sung, is exactly what you need for this situation.

</details>

- 
87.	 In ancient times, murderers were often _____ (to hang) in the public square.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

87.
**hanged (In ancient times, murderers were often hanged in the public square.)**
The verb to hang has two important meanings — one, as in this sentence, refers to the execution of a criminal. The other is the verb that refers to hanging an object on a wall. For this sentence, you want the first meaning. The past-tense form for that meaning is hanged.

</details>

- 
88.	 The picture _____ (to hang) on the wall for years, but no one noticed it.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

88.
**hung (The picture hung on the wall for years, but no one noticed it.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

89.
**will have swept (The janitor will have swept the sidewalk before the students arrive, so**
expect a clean path.) The sentence states a deadline — before the students arrive. Future perfect tense works well with deadlines, so will have swept is the form you want. The simple future form, will sweep, or the present tense, sweeps, also fit this sentence.

90.	 The riflemen _____ (to lay) down their weapons but are ready to resume target practice at a moment’s notice.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

90.
**have laid (The riflemen have laid down their weapons but are ready to resume target**
practice at a moment’s notice.) Two verbs, to lie and to lay, can be confusing. The first means to lie down, what you do when you take a nap. The second means to put or to place, which you do when you place a rifle on the ground. The present perfect form of to lay is has or have laid. Here you pair it with have because the subject, riflemen, is plural. Why present perfect tense? The action in the past (have laid down their weapons) is connected to the pres- ent, when they are ready to resume their practice.

## Dealing with To Be and To Have
### 91–105 Select the proper form of the verb to be or to have to fit the meaning of the sentence.

91.	 The marble statue _____ (to be) on the shelf right now, but earlier it was in the sculptor’s studio.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

91.
**is (The marble statue is on the shelf right now, but earlier it was in the sculptor’s studio.)**
You know that the situation in the sentence takes place in the present tense because of the phrase right now. The third-person, singular form is works well because you are talking about the statue; therefore, you need a third-person form.

</details>

- 
92.	 Along with Jack, I _____ (to be) bored and decided to watch a different show.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

92.
**was (Along with Jack, I was bored and decided to watch a different show.)**
The sentence talks about something in the past, when I decided to watch anything other than the yawn-producing show on the television. The first-person form (when the speaker is the subject) is what you want. Therefore, the answer is was.

</details>

- 
93.	 The co-presidents _____ (to have) no trouble persuading club members to go out for pizza when they suggest the excur- sion at the end of the meeting, because ­everyone will be hungry then.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

93.
**will have (The co-presidents will have no trouble persuading club members to go out for**
pizza when they suggest the excursion at the end of the meeting, because everyone will be hungry then.) The clues here are when they suggest and everyone will be, which indicate that you are in the future tense. Singular and plural forms are the same in the future tense. Go for will have.

- 
94.	 Louisa rejected the sofa when it was delivered because it _____ (to have) a stain on one cushion.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

94.
**had (Louisa rejected the sofa when it was delivered because it had a stain on one cushion.)**
The sofa is already in the house (it was delivered), so you know you need past tense. The third-person form (the one used to talk about something) is what you want. The verb had is the answer.

</details>

- 
95.	 Max _____ (to be) sick for the last two days, but the doctor predicts that his temperature will be normal tomorrow.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

95.
**has been (Max has been sick for the last two days, but the doctor predicts that his temper-**
ature will be normal tomorrow.) The sentence ranges over the past (the last two days) and the present (predicts). Present perfect tense connects these two time periods. Go for the singular, third-person form, has been, because you’re talking about Max. When you talk about someone or something, you need a third-person form.

</details>

- 
96.	 The lottery winners _____ (to be) difficult; they refuse to share their winnings.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

96.
**are being (The lottery winners are being difficult; they refuse to share their winnings.)**
The second portion of the sentence talks about something happening right now, so you’re in the present tense. The action is ongoing, so the present progressive form is appropriate. Because you have winners, a plural, you want a plural form, are being.

</details>

- 
97.	 If the referee and the coach can’t agree, our efforts _____ (to be) fruitless because we will forfeit the game.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

97.
**will be (If the referee and the coach can’t agree, our efforts will be fruitless because we**
will forfeit the game.) The sentence talks about a possible event in the future, when we will forfeit. The future- tense will be matches nicely.

</details>

- 
98.	 Shelley _____ (to have) difficulty getting up on time ever since her alarm clock broke, but she plans to buy a new one soon.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

98.
**has had (Shelley has had difficulty getting up on time ever since her alarm clock broke,**
but she plans to buy a new one soon.) The first portion of the sentence talks about two time periods — when the alarm clock broke (past) and her present difficulty. Present perfect tense is, well, perfect for this sentence because it connects past and present. The present progressive form, is having, also works here, because Shelley’s difficulty is ongoing.

</details>

- 
99.	 While the elevators were rising, the mechanic _____ (to have) doubts about the strange noises below.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

99.
**was having (While the elevators were rising, the mechanic was having doubts about the**
strange noises below.) The first part of the sentence tells you about an ongoing action in the past, so past ­progressive tense makes sense for the second part of the sentence also. The mechanic is singular, and you’re talking about him, so opt for the third-person, singular, past ­progressive form, was having. Note: The simple past tense, had, also works here.

</details>

- 
100.	 We _____ (to be) here, patiently waiting, for more than four hours before Justin arrived.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

100.
**had been (We had been here, patiently waiting, for more than four hours before Justin**
arrived.) Two actions occur in the past, but one, the waiting, happened first. Go for we had been, the first-person, plural form of the past perfect tense. Past perfect tense places one event in the past prior to another.

</details>

- 
101.	 When Doreen _____ (to be) 13, she strug- gled to start her business, but one day sales began to rise.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

101.
**was (When Doreen was 13, she struggled to start her business, but one day sales began**
to rise.) You’re in the past when you talk about a business owner at age 13! (Another clue is struggled, which also indicates the past.) Go for the singular, past-tense form — was.

</details>

- 
102.	 By the time it opens on Broadway, the show _____ (to have) four different directors.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

102.
**will have had (By the time it opens on Broadway, the show will have had four different**
directors.) See the deadline in this sentence? It’s by the time it opens. A deadline tells you that you need future perfect tense, or will have had.

</details>

- 
103.	 Gina, who _____ (to be) your friend, begs you to forgive her.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

103.
**is (Gina, who is your friend, begs you to forgive her.)**
Because who stands in for Gina (in grammar terminology, Gina acts as the antecedent of who), you need a form that matches Gina. The verb is works well here, because you’re in present tense.

</details>

- 
104.	 Doug, who _____ (to be) very immature in those days, used to stick gum under everyone’s desk.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

104.
**was (Doug, who was very immature in those days, used to stick gum under everyone’s**
desk.) Two things were happening at the same time in this sentence: Doug’s immaturity and his pranks with gum. Because the statement about gum is in past tense, the statement about immaturity should be also. Doug is singular, so opt for was, a singular, past-tense form.

</details>

- 
105.	 Sam thought that his mom _____ (to have) a stroke, but fortunately he was wrong; it was just a headache.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

105.
**had had (Sam thought that his mom had had a stroke, but fortunately he was wrong; it was**
just a headache.) This verb form sounds like a typo, but it’s actually the past perfect tense. Two actions took place in the past — Sam’s thinking and whatever happened to his mom. The think- ing occurred after the illness started, so it’s expressed in simple past tense (thought). To place the illness earlier in the timeline, go for past perfect, had had. Another possi- ble answer is was having, in which case the thinking and the illness are simultaneous.

107.
**may fly (Alice may fly to Buenos Aires on business next week.)**
The helping verb may introduces a possibility in the present time. Did you consider might fly or could fly? These helping verbs also serve to express a possible action, but the strictest, most formal English generally reserves might and could for past-tense situations, as in yesterday Alice could go to Buenos Aires, but next week she cannot.

**may choose (Because she loves that color, Helen may choose only green blocks for her**
playhouse.) The helping verb may introduces a possibility in the present time. Did you consider might choose or could choose?

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

117.
**might prepare (Seven hours ago, Otis said that he might prepare dinner, but we are still**
waiting, hungrier than ever.) The helping verb might adds possibility to the verb prepare. Because you’re in the past tense, might works better in this sentence than may, another helping verb of possibility.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

119.
**would have gone (If it had not rained, Sam would have gone for a walk.)**
The helping verb would expresses a condition — the circumstances needed for Sam’s willingness to go for a walk, and have gone places the action in the past. Did you answer might have gone? That shades the meaning slightly, expressing the possibility of Sam’s walking. Because the question specifies condition, would have gone is the better choice.

124.
**Does Eugene have (Does Eugene have too many video games, according to his friend**
James?) The statement (Eugene has too many video games, according to his friend, James) gets by with one present-tense verb, has. Another, less common possibility is Has Eugene too many video games, according to his friend James? However, the usual way to begin this question is Does Eugene have.

125.
**did Steven blow (After he had chewed his gum for an hour, did Steven blow an enormous**
bubble?) The first part of the sentence tells you that an hour passed, so you know that you’re in the past tense here. Past-tense questions may be created with the helping verb did. The subject, Steven, belongs between the helping verb and the main verb.

**Does the wire between the fenceposts sag (Does the wire between the fenceposts sag so**

127.
**Is Deborah not (Is Deborah not interested in reading that poem aloud?)**
No helping verbs are needed to turn this statement, which contains the verb is, into a ques- tion. In fact, if the main verb of a sentence is a form of to be, you can usually forget about helping verbs when you’re creating a question. However, you should rearrange the word order to ask a question in formal English. Another possible answer is Isn’t Deborah. Isn’t is a contraction, a shortened form that substitutes an apostrophe for the omitted letter o.

129.
**Did Ellie go (Did Ellie go to the skating rink when it was closed?)**
The past-tense form of the verb to go is went, but you can’t pair a helping verb with went to create a question — or for any other reason. Instead, you need to return to the infinitive, pull out the go, and add the past-tense helping verb, did, to ask a question in Standard English.

**Did the winning essay compare (Did the winning essay compare face-to-face communica-**
tion with social media relationships?) The past-tense form, compared, drops out of this sentence when you change it into a question. The helping verb did (which is a past-tense form) is separated from the main verb, compare, by the subject, the winning essay.

137.
**tired**
The sentence has two parts: one in quotation marks and one that “tags” the quotation by identifying the speaker. Inside the quotation, the verb is have done. No word there functions as a description. In the other part of the sentence, screamed is a verb that tells you what Andrew is doing. The word tired gives you more information about Andrew, but it doesn’t function as a verb. Did you select nagging also? In this sentence, nagging is a noun — the “thing” Andrew can’t stand! It’s not a description.
