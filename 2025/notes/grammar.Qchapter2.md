# Chapter 2
## Taking a Look at Irregular, Helping, and Descriptive Verb Forms
Every year, my students are upset to discover that English has so many irregular verbs. If I were the Queen of Grammar, I’d outlaw irregular verbs. Unfortunately, without them I wouldn’t be able to fashion the first sentence of this chapter, because are would be behind bars. So would has! Like it or not, and because I’m not the *Queen of Grammar*, you and I are stuck with irregulars. Not to worry: In this chapter you practice selecting irregular verbs,changing meaning with helping verbs (should, can, may, do, does, did, and the like), and employing verb forms that can act as descriptions, which grammarians call participles and infinitives and the rest of us call “pains in the neck.”

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that develop these skills:
✓	Using irregular past-tense and participle forms correctly
✓	Selecting the proper form and tense of the irregular verbs to be and to have
✓	Adding shades of meaning with the helping verbs should, must, can, could, may, might,
and would
✓	Creating questions with helping verbs
✓	Identifying participles functioning as descriptions
✓	Choosing the best form of participles and infinitives used as descriptions
## What to watch out for
Keep these points in mind when you answer the questions in this chapter:
✓	Check whether the past-tense form or participle is regular or irregular.
✓	Choose the correct tense of irregular verbs based on the meaning of the sentence.
✓	Employ reading comprehension skills to detect the need for a helping verb expressing
obligation, possibility, condition, or ability.
✓	Rearrange word order and add helping verbs to create questions.
✓	Select present participles or infinitives as descriptions for actions in the past, present, or future.

## Handling Irregular Verbs
### 66–90 Choose the proper past, present perfect, past perfect, or future perfect form of the irregular verb in parentheses so that the verb fits the meaning of the sentence.

66.	 Joe _____ (to catch) the ball as it reached the top of the outfield fence.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

66.
**caught (Joe caught the ball as it reached the top of the outfield fence.)**
The action takes place in the past, because the ball reached (past tense) the fence when Joe caught it. The irregular past-tense form of to catch is caught.

67.	 The car was cruising along the highway smoothly until it _____ (to hit) a huge bump.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

67.
**hit (The car was cruising along the highway smoothly until it hit a huge bump.)**
The action is in the past, as the first verb, was cruising, tells you. The second verb should be in the past also, but because hitting a bump isn’t an event stretching over a time period, as cruising is, the simple past tense is best. Hit is the irregular past-tense form of to hit.

- 
68.	 Dorothy and the baby _____ (to sleep) for two hours when they returned from a visit to Grandma.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

68.
**slept (Dorothy and the baby slept for two hours when they returned from a visit to**
Grandma.) You need the simple past tense for the first part of this sentence, in order to match the past-tense verb (returned) in the second part of the sentence. The irregular past-tense form of to sleep is slept.

</details>

- 
69.	 At the end of the trial the judge _____ (to rise) from her chair and left the courtroom.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

69.
**rose (At the end of the trial the judge rose from her chair and left the courtroom.)**
The sentence talks about the past (left), so you need a past-tense verb for the blank. The irregular past-tense form of to rise is rose.

</details>

- 
70.	 Last week the Yankees _____ (to beat) their fiercest rivals.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

70.
**beat (Last week the Yankees beat their fiercest rivals.)**
The irregular past-tense form of to beat is beat. You know you need past tense because the sentence refers to last week.

</details>

- 
71.	 From 2010 through 2011, the confused clerk _____ (to put) all the forms in the wrong file cabinet.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

71.
**put (From 2010 through 2011, the confused clerk put all the forms in the wrong file**
cabinet.) The time range (2010 through 2011) tells you that you’re in the past. The irregular past- tense form of to put is put.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

72.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

74.
**swam (I didn’t know that you swam in the deep water last summer; I thought you were less**
advanced in your swimming skills.) The irregular past-tense form of to swim is swam. The words last summer indicate that you need past tense in this sentence.

</details>

75.	 Nelson wouldn’t _____ (to get) sick if he had washed his hands more frequently.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

75.
**have gotten (Nelson wouldn’t have gotten sick if he had washed his hands more**
frequently.) The irregular past participle of to get is gotten, not got, in American usage. Therefore, have gotten is correct here.

</details>

- 
76.	 The bully approached, but because my uncle _____ (to teach) me how to handle difficult people, I wasn’t afraid.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

76.
**had taught (The bully approached, but because my uncle had taught me how to handle**
difficult people, I wasn’t afraid.) The sentence covers two time periods in the past — when the uncle taught and when the bully approached. The teaching takes place before the approaching, so the earlier action should be expressed in past perfect tense. The irregular past perfect form of to teach is had taught.

</details>

- 
77.	 The doctor _____ (to do) everything in his power; now Allison must wait for the medicine to take effect.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

77.
**has done (The doctor has done everything in his power; now Allison must wait for the**
medicine to take effect.) The doctor acted and now Allison is waiting, so past and present are connected in this sentence. The present perfect tense does the job here. The irregular present perfect form of to do is has done. The simple past tense, did, is also acceptable.

</details>

- 
78.	 Miriam _____ (to let) the dog out for a few minutes, but she will call him inside soon.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

78.
**let (Miriam let the dog out for a few minutes, but she will call him inside soon.)**
Miriam’s action occurred already, so past tense is appropriate for this sentence. The irregular past-tense form of to let is let.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

80.
**began (“Who began the fight, you or your brother?” asked Mother as she separated her**
battling children.) The irregular past-tense form of to begin is began. The mother asked, so past tense makes sense. (Also, you can’t ask about the beginning of a fight until it has begun!)

</details>

81.	 After you _____ (to send) the letter, shred the scrap copies.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

81.
**have sent (After you have sent the letter, shred the scrap copies.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

82.
**froze (At first the rain was simply annoying, but when it froze, the streets became very**
slippery and many pedestrians fell.) Three events take place more or less at the same time — the change from water to ice, the formation of slippery sidewalks, and the crash landing of many pedestrians. Because these events are simultaneous, the irregular past-tense form, froze, is what you want here.

</details>

83.	 Albert _____ (to tear) his shirt when he crawled through the obstacle course.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

83.
**tore (Albert tore his shirt when he crawled through the obstacle course.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

84.
**knew (“I knew it!” exclaimed the detective as the murderer confessed.)**
The detective’s exclamation refers to one action in the past, not to a series of actions that must be put in order, a situation that requires the use of the past perfect tense. The simple past-tense form, knew, does the job here.

</details>

- 
85.	 When she attempted to pay for her coffee, Lee discovered that she _____ (to lose) all her coins because of a small hole in her pocket.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

85.
**had lost (When she attempted to pay for her coffee, Lee discovered that she had lost all**
her coins because of a small hole in her pocket.) The sentence mentions several events in the past. Attempting to pay for the coffee and discovering the hole happen more or less at the same time, but losing the coins occurs earlier. The earlier action is expressed with the past perfect tense, had lost. The other actions (attempted, discovered) are in simple past tense.

</details>

- 
86.	 By midnight Angie _____ (to sing) that aria enough times to set a world record.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

86.
**will have sung (By midnight Angie will have sung that aria enough times to set a world**
record.) The sentence contains a deadline (by midnight) and an action that will take place before the deadline (the singing). The future perfect tense, will have sung, is exactly what you need for this situation.

</details>

- 
87.	 In ancient times, murderers were often _____ (to hang) in the public square.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

87.
**hanged (In ancient times, murderers were often hanged in the public square.)**
The verb to hang has two important meanings — one, as in this sentence, refers to the execution of a criminal. The other is the verb that refers to hanging an object on a wall. For this sentence, you want the first meaning. The past-tense form for that meaning is hanged.

</details>

- 
88.	 The picture _____ (to hang) on the wall for years, but no one noticed it.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

88.
**hung (The picture hung on the wall for years, but no one noticed it.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

89.
**will have swept (The janitor will have swept the sidewalk before the students arrive, so**
expect a clean path.) The sentence states a deadline — before the students arrive. Future perfect tense works well with deadlines, so will have swept is the form you want. The simple future form, will sweep, or the present tense, sweeps, also fit this sentence.

90.	 The riflemen _____ (to lay) down their weapons but are ready to resume target practice at a moment’s notice.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

90.
**have laid (The riflemen have laid down their weapons but are ready to resume target**
practice at a moment’s notice.) Two verbs, to lie and to lay, can be confusing. The first means to lie down, what you do when you take a nap. The second means to put or to place, which you do when you place a rifle on the ground. The present perfect form of to lay is has or have laid. Here you pair it with have because the subject, riflemen, is plural. Why present perfect tense? The action in the past (have laid down their weapons) is connected to the pres- ent, when they are ready to resume their practice.

## Dealing with To Be and To Have
### 91–105 Select the proper form of the verb to be or to have to fit the meaning of the sentence.

91.	 The marble statue _____ (to be) on the shelf right now, but earlier it was in the sculptor’s studio.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

91.
**is (The marble statue is on the shelf right now, but earlier it was in the sculptor’s studio.)**
You know that the situation in the sentence takes place in the present tense because of the phrase right now. The third-person, singular form is works well because you are talking about the statue; therefore, you need a third-person form.

</details>

- 
92.	 Along with Jack, I _____ (to be) bored and decided to watch a different show.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

92.
**was (Along with Jack, I was bored and decided to watch a different show.)**
The sentence talks about something in the past, when I decided to watch anything other than the yawn-producing show on the television. The first-person form (when the speaker is the subject) is what you want. Therefore, the answer is was.

</details>

- 
93.	 The co-presidents _____ (to have) no trouble persuading club members to go out for pizza when they suggest the excur- sion at the end of the meeting, because ­everyone will be hungry then.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

93.
**will have (The co-presidents will have no trouble persuading club members to go out for**
pizza when they suggest the excursion at the end of the meeting, because everyone will be hungry then.) The clues here are when they suggest and everyone will be, which indicate that you are in the future tense. Singular and plural forms are the same in the future tense. Go for will have.

- 
94.	 Louisa rejected the sofa when it was delivered because it _____ (to have) a stain on one cushion.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

94.
**had (Louisa rejected the sofa when it was delivered because it had a stain on one cushion.)**
The sofa is already in the house (it was delivered), so you know you need past tense. The third-person form (the one used to talk about something) is what you want. The verb had is the answer.

</details>

- 
95.	 Max _____ (to be) sick for the last two days, but the doctor predicts that his temperature will be normal tomorrow.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

95.
**has been (Max has been sick for the last two days, but the doctor predicts that his temper-**
ature will be normal tomorrow.) The sentence ranges over the past (the last two days) and the present (predicts). Present perfect tense connects these two time periods. Go for the singular, third-person form, has been, because you’re talking about Max. When you talk about someone or something, you need a third-person form.

</details>

- 
96.	 The lottery winners _____ (to be) difficult; they refuse to share their winnings.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

96.
**are being (The lottery winners are being difficult; they refuse to share their winnings.)**
The second portion of the sentence talks about something happening right now, so you’re in the present tense. The action is ongoing, so the present progressive form is appropriate. Because you have winners, a plural, you want a plural form, are being.

</details>

- 
97.	 If the referee and the coach can’t agree, our efforts _____ (to be) fruitless because we will forfeit the game.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

97.
**will be (If the referee and the coach can’t agree, our efforts will be fruitless because we**
will forfeit the game.) The sentence talks about a possible event in the future, when we will forfeit. The future- tense will be matches nicely.

</details>

- 
98.	 Shelley _____ (to have) difficulty getting up on time ever since her alarm clock broke, but she plans to buy a new one soon.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

98.
**has had (Shelley has had difficulty getting up on time ever since her alarm clock broke,**
but she plans to buy a new one soon.) The first portion of the sentence talks about two time periods — when the alarm clock broke (past) and her present difficulty. Present perfect tense is, well, perfect for this sentence because it connects past and present. The present progressive form, is having, also works here, because Shelley’s difficulty is ongoing.

</details>

- 
99.	 While the elevators were rising, the mechanic _____ (to have) doubts about the strange noises below.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

99.
**was having (While the elevators were rising, the mechanic was having doubts about the**
strange noises below.) The first part of the sentence tells you about an ongoing action in the past, so past ­progressive tense makes sense for the second part of the sentence also. The mechanic is singular, and you’re talking about him, so opt for the third-person, singular, past ­progressive form, was having. Note: The simple past tense, had, also works here.

</details>

- 
100.	 We _____ (to be) here, patiently waiting, for more than four hours before Justin arrived.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

100.
**had been (We had been here, patiently waiting, for more than four hours before Justin**
arrived.) Two actions occur in the past, but one, the waiting, happened first. Go for we had been, the first-person, plural form of the past perfect tense. Past perfect tense places one event in the past prior to another.

</details>

- 
101.	 When Doreen _____ (to be) 13, she strug- gled to start her business, but one day sales began to rise.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

101.
**was (When Doreen was 13, she struggled to start her business, but one day sales began**
to rise.) You’re in the past when you talk about a business owner at age 13! (Another clue is struggled, which also indicates the past.) Go for the singular, past-tense form — was.

</details>

- 
102.	 By the time it opens on Broadway, the show _____ (to have) four different directors.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

102.
**will have had (By the time it opens on Broadway, the show will have had four different**
directors.) See the deadline in this sentence? It’s by the time it opens. A deadline tells you that you need future perfect tense, or will have had.

</details>

- 
103.	 Gina, who _____ (to be) your friend, begs you to forgive her.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

103.
**is (Gina, who is your friend, begs you to forgive her.)**
Because who stands in for Gina (in grammar terminology, Gina acts as the antecedent of who), you need a form that matches Gina. The verb is works well here, because you’re in present tense.

</details>

- 
104.	 Doug, who _____ (to be) very immature in those days, used to stick gum under everyone’s desk.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

104.
**was (Doug, who was very immature in those days, used to stick gum under everyone’s**
desk.) Two things were happening at the same time in this sentence: Doug’s immaturity and his pranks with gum. Because the statement about gum is in past tense, the statement about immaturity should be also. Doug is singular, so opt for was, a singular, past-tense form.

</details>

- 
105.	 Sam thought that his mom _____ (to have) a stroke, but fortunately he was wrong; it was just a headache.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

105.
**had had (Sam thought that his mom had had a stroke, but fortunately he was wrong; it was**
just a headache.) This verb form sounds like a typo, but it’s actually the past perfect tense. Two actions took place in the past — Sam’s thinking and whatever happened to his mom. The think- ing occurred after the illness started, so it’s expressed in simple past tense (thought). To place the illness earlier in the timeline, go for past perfect, had had. Another possi- ble answer is was having, in which case the thinking and the illness are simultaneous.

107.
**may fly (Alice may fly to Buenos Aires on business next week.)**
The helping verb may introduces a possibility in the present time. Did you consider might fly or could fly? These helping verbs also serve to express a possible action, but the strictest, most formal English generally reserves might and could for past-tense situations, as in yesterday Alice could go to Buenos Aires, but next week she cannot.

**may choose (Because she loves that color, Helen may choose only green blocks for her**
playhouse.) The helping verb may introduces a possibility in the present time. Did you consider might choose or could choose?

117.
**might prepare (Seven hours ago, Otis said that he might prepare dinner, but we are still**
waiting, hungrier than ever.) The helping verb might adds possibility to the verb prepare. Because you’re in the past tense, might works better in this sentence than may, another helping verb of possibility.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

119.
**would have gone (If it had not rained, Sam would have gone for a walk.)**
The helping verb would expresses a condition — the circumstances needed for Sam’s willingness to go for a walk, and have gone places the action in the past. Did you answer might have gone? That shades the meaning slightly, expressing the possibility of Sam’s walking. Because the question specifies condition, would have gone is the better choice.

**Will Jefferson attend (Will Jefferson attend the committee meeting this afternoon, despite**
his busy schedule?) The future-tense verb, will attend, is interrupted by the subject, Jefferson, in a question.

124.
**Does Eugene have (Does Eugene have too many video games, according to his friend**
James?) The statement (Eugene has too many video games, according to his friend, James) gets by with one present-tense verb, has. Another, less common possibility is Has Eugene too many video games, according to his friend James? However, the usual way to begin this question is Does Eugene have.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

125.
**did Steven blow (After he had chewed his gum for an hour, did Steven blow an enormous**
bubble?) The first part of the sentence tells you that an hour passed, so you know that you’re in the past tense here. Past-tense questions may be created with the helping verb did. The subject, Steven, belongs between the helping verb and the main verb.

126.
**Does the wire between the fenceposts sag (Does the wire between the fenceposts sag so**
low that cattle cross easily from one field to the next?) The helping verb does pairs with the main verb sag to create a question. Wire is singu- lar, so does is the helping verb you need, not do.

127.
**Is Deborah not (Is Deborah not interested in reading that poem aloud?)**
No helping verbs are needed to turn this statement, which contains the verb is, into a ques- tion. In fact, if the main verb of a sentence is a form of to be, you can usually forget about helping verbs when you’re creating a question. However, you should rearrange the word order to ask a question in formal English. Another possible answer is Isn’t Deborah. Isn’t is a contraction, a shortened form that substitutes an apostrophe for the omitted letter o.

**Did Ellie go (Did Ellie go to the skating rink when it was closed?)**
The past-tense form of the verb to go is went, but you can’t pair a helping verb with went to create a question — or for any other reason. Instead, you need to return to the infinitive, pull out the go, and add the past-tense helping verb, did, to ask a question in Standard English.

**Did the winning essay compare (Did the winning essay compare face-to-face communica-**
tion with social media relationships?) The past-tense form, compared, drops out of this sentence when you change it into a question. The helping verb did (which is a past-tense form) is separated from the main verb, compare, by the subject, the winning essay.

<details>

134.	 Confused, Eliza is sorting through the instructions for her new computer and printer.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

134.
**confused**
The main action in the sentence is expressed by the verb, is sorting. The verb form ­confused, a form of the verb to confuse, adds information about Eliza, but it functions as a description.

- 
137.	 “I have done my homework!” screamed Andrew, tired of his mother’s nagging.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

137.
**tired**
The sentence has two parts: one in quotation marks and one that “tags” the quotation by identifying the speaker. Inside the quotation, the verb is have done. No word there functions as a description. In the other part of the sentence, screamed is a verb that tells you what Andrew is doing. The word tired gives you more information about Andrew, but it doesn’t function as a verb. Did you select nagging also? In this sentence, nagging is a noun — the “thing” Andrew can’t stand! It’s not a description.

</details>

- 
138.	 The research was done by laboratories around the world, all funded by one generous donor.

139.
**hired**
Several words function as verbs in this sentence: is performing, hates, does, and wishes. Only one verb form is a description: hired. Did you choose conceited? True, that word resembles a verb because it ends in -ed. However, to conceit isn’t a verb; in fact, it isn’t even a word! Conceited is simply an adjective.

140.
**sunning**
The sentence contains two verbs, slithered and came. The word hikers may look like the verb to hike, but it’s just a noun. The descriptive verb form in this sentence is sunning.

## Selecting Tense for Descriptive Verb Forms
### 141–150 Which form of the verb in parentheses works best as a description in the sentence?
 
141.	 _____ (to prepare) the room for redecora- tion, Vincent discovered a crack that grew longer with every tug of the wallpaper he was removing.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

141.
**Preparing (Preparing the room for redecoration, Vincent discovered a crack that grew**
longer with every tug of the wallpaper he was removing.) Your reading comprehension skills tell you that Vincent’s tug on the old paper happens at the same time as the preparation of the room for redecoration. Therefore, the pres- ent participle, preparing, is correct.

</details>

142.
**Speaking (Speaking with intense emotion, the actor recites his lines every night without a**
trace of boredom.) Two clues tell you that this sentence describes an ongoing situation: the main, present- tense verb (recites) and every night. For an ongoing situation, the present participle, speaking, works nicely.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

144.
**vowing to fight (The mayor, vowing to fight crime, will increase the number of police**
officers.) The main verb in the sentence, will increase, refers to the future. The present participle (vowing) is a good fit for a sentence with a future-tense verb, as is the present-tense infinitive, to fight, and the present perfect form, having vowed to fight.

</details>

living room.) The present participle, standing, indicates that the desk is there at the same time that the cat raked his claws on it. Present participles express simultaneous events.

**Having walked (Having walked the entire shoreline this morning, Ed can assure the**
reporters at tonight’s news conference that all the beaches are ready to reopen.) To crack this sentence, make a timeline. First comes the walk, then the news confer- ence, and then the reopening of the beaches. To place the walk before the news confer- ence, use the perfect form, having walked.

**to meet (“It’s great to meet you!” exclaimed Paul as he shook hands with his new tennis**
partner, who had never seen Paul before in his life.) Your reading comprehension skills tell you that Paul’s comment about meeting his partner refers to the same moment he extends his hand for a shake. The simple infini- tive, to meet, expresses simultaneous events. You don’t need the perfect form, which places one event before another.

# Chapter 3
## One to Many: Forming Plurals of Nouns and Pronouns
According to one website, as of January, 2013, the English language was made up of - 1,019, 729.	 6 words. I don’t believe that anyone actually knows — or can know — how - many words are in any language. (And what on earth is 0.6 of a word?) So you can forget - about numbers when you study proper English, with one huge exception: You have to pay - attention to singular and plural forms of nouns and pronouns. In this chapter, you practice - with nouns, turning one (the singular form) into many (the plural form). You also sort - singular and plural pronouns, so that you can match them appropriately with the words - they represent.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that cover the following concepts:
✓	Forming plurals of common and proper nouns, both regular and irregular
✓	Creating plural forms of hyphenated and compound words
✓	Tackling difficult pronouns such as everything, one, either, all, some, that, which who, and so forth What to watch out for

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Most nouns form the plural by adding the letter s. For nouns ending in ch, sh, x, s, and z, add es.
✓	Nouns ending in a y change the y to i and add es if the letter preceding the y is a consonant (any letter except a, e, i, o, or u).
✓	Add s or es to the most important word in a hyphenated or compound noun.
✓	These pronouns are always singular: one, everyone, everything, everybody, no one,
nothing, nobody, someone, something, somebody, either, neither, each, other, and another.
✓	These pronouns are always plural: few, both, several, and many.
✓	Relative pronouns (that, which, who) are singular if they refer to singular nouns
or pronouns and plural if they refer to plural nouns or pronouns.
✓	These pronouns can be either singular or plural: all, any, most, some, and none. If one of these pronouns refers to a plural (for example, all of the shows, in which all refers to shows), the pronoun is plural. If the pronoun refers to a singular (for example, most of the air, in which most refers to air), the pronoun is singular.

## Forming Plural Nouns
### 151–165 What is the correct plural form of these nouns?
 
151.	 stitch, telephone, tax

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

729.
**I. and II. (I. Because the air is dry, the plant needs water more often. II. In dry air, the**
plant needs water more often.) In Sentences I and II, statements about the air (Because the air is dry and in dry air) introduce the main idea (the plant needs water more often). Sentences I and II convey meaning efficiently and correctly. Sentence III (Needing water more often, the air is dry for the plant) mangles the meaning, because an introductory verb form (Needing water more often, in this sentence) attaches to the subject (air, in this sentence). Sentence III doesn’t work.

</details>

- 
152.	 dye, splash, sandal

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

152.
**dyes, splashes, sandals**
The words dye and sandal need only an s to form the plural. Splash, however, ends in sh, so you need to add es to form the plural.

</details>

- 
153.	 tomato, catch, mug

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

153.
**tomatoes, catches, mugs**
The addition of s creates the plural of mug. The word catch, which ends with ch, needs es to form the plural. So does tomato. In general, a noun ending in o forms the plural with es if the letter preceding the o is a consonant. (A consonant is any letter except a, e, i, o or u.)

</details>

- 
154.	 monkey, turkey, baby

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

154.
**monkeys, turkeys, babies**
To form the plural of a word ending in y, you add s if the y is preceded by a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). You change the y to i and add es if the y is preceded by a consonant (any letter that isn’t a vowel). Therefore, monkey and turkey need only an s, because the second-to-last letter in each word is a vowel, e. Baby, on the other hand, changes to babies, because the second-to-last letter is a consonant, b.

</details>

- 
155.	 zoo, success, edge

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

155.
**zoos, successes, edges**
To form the plural of a noun ending in o, you generally add only an s if the letter pre- ceding the final o is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). Therefore, zoos is the correct plural form. Words ending in the letter s form the plural with es, so go for successes. The word edge needs an s, and nothing more, to form the plural.

</details>

- 
156.	 child, woman, man

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

156.
**children, women, men**
These three words are irregular. None form the plural with s or es. Instead, the whole word changes! For help with irregular plurals, check your dictionary. Near the singular form you should see the abbreviation pl., which stands for plural, followed by the plural form.

</details>

- 
157.	 deer, elephant, month

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

157.
**deer, elephants, months**
Animal plurals can be tricky, so you should check your dictionary if you aren’t sure of the proper form. The plural of deer is deer! No change at all. On the other hand, you may see one elephant or two elephants while you’re on a safari. The plural of month is months.

</details>

- 
158.	 light, batch, biography

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

158.
**lights, batches, biographies**
A simple s is enough for the plural of light. Add es to batch, because it ends with ch. A consonant precedes the y in biography, so you change the y to i and add es. (A conso- nant is any letter except a, e, i, o, or u.)

</details>

- 
159.	 microphone, jelly, virus

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

159.
**microphones, jellies, viruses**
Add the letter s to form the plural of microphone. Because jelly ends in a y preceded by a consonant (any letter except a, e, i, o, or u), form the plural by changing the y to i and adding es. Add es to virus to form the plural, viruses, because the singular form ends in s.

</details>

- 
160.	 delivery, essay, wife

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

160.
**deliveries, essays, wives**
Remember the rule about words ending in y: Add s if the letter preceding the y is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). Change the y to i and add es if a consonant (any letter that isn’t a vowel) precedes the y. Using this rule, you get deliveries (because a consonant pre- cedes the y in delivery) and essays (because a vowel precedes the y in essay). The word wife has an irregular plural form, wives.

</details>

- 
161.	 Smith, Jones, O’Toole

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

161.
**Smiths, Joneses, O’Tooles**
To form the plural of names, add es to names ending in ch, sh, x, s, and z, and a simple s to everything else. Don’t form a plural of a name with an apostrophe!

</details>

- 
162.	 leaf, pitch, copy

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

162.
**leaves, pitches, copies**
The irregular plural of leaf is leaves. (Always check your dictionary if you’re unsure whether a plural is regular or irregular.) Pitch ends in ch, so you add es to form the plural. Copy ends with y preceded by a consonant (any letter that isn’t a, e, i, o, or u), so change the y to i and add es to form the plural.

</details>

- 
163.	 son-in-law, kangaroo, tooth

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

163.
**sons-in-law, kangaroos, teeth**
For a hyphenated word, zero in on the most important word and make that word plural — and nothing else! Therefore, the proper plural form is sons-in-law, because the family relationship (son) is highlighted. For words ending in o, you usually add an s if the letter preceding the o is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). Therefore, the plural of kangaroo is kangaroos. Teeth is an irregular plural. (Always check your dictionary if you’re unsure whether a plural is regular or irregular.)

</details>

164.	 alumnus, mass medium, Woods

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

164.
**alumni, mass media, Woodses**
The irregular plural of alumnus, a word that comes down to us via Latin, is alumni (or, for a group composed solely of females, alumnae). Similarly, the plural of medium, another word of Latin origin, is media, unless you’re using the word to mean a size (three mediums sold this morning but no smalls) or a psychic (Jim consulted three mediums in order to communicate with his dead pet). To form the plural of my last name, Woods, add es because the name ends with an s.

</details>

- 
165.	 species, statistic, vice president

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

165.
**species, statistics, vice presidents**
Trick question here: You can have one species or two species — same spelling. Statistic takes an s to form the plural. For the compound word, vice president, add an s to the most important part, which in this case is president.

If the word referred to is plural, the pronoun is plural. In this sentence, all refers to birds, a plural noun. Therefore, all is plural here. Most refers to water, a singular noun, so most is singular here.

# Chapter 4
## Identifying Subjects and Per  fecting Subject-Verb Agreement
What are you talking about, at this exact moment? That’s the subject of your - conversation. While I’m on the subject of subjects, I must mention that every sentence - has a subject — the who or what being discussed. The most important aspect of subjects - is agreement: not smiling and saying, “Yes! Yes!” but rather ensuring that a singular subject - pairs with a singular verb form and a plural subject pairs with a plural verb form. In this - chapter, you find the subject and then play matchmaker between subjects and verbs. (If you - have trouble identifying the verb, turn to Chapters 1 and 2 for extra help.)

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that cover the following concepts:
✓	Finding the subject in statements, questions, and commands
✓	Identifying compound subjects and pronouns acting as subjects
✓	Choosing the correct verb for every subject-verb pair

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	To find the subject, first locate the verb(s) in the sentence. Ask who? or what? is performing the action or is in the state of being expressed by the verb.
✓	Don’t be fooled by location. Most subjects appear before the verb, but some follow the verb. Use your reading comprehension skills to answer the who? or what? questions.
✓	Most subjects and verbs show up with descriptions attached. Ignore distracting words or phrases and concentrate on the real subject-verb pair.
✓	Verb forms used as descriptions or as nouns may resemble verbs without functioning
as the verb in the sentence. When you ask who? or what? to find the subject, be sure you’re working from the real verb.
✓	The subject in a command may be an understood, but not stated, you.
✓	Pronouns acting as subjects can be tricky. Check out Chapter 3 for help distinguishing singular and plural pronouns.

## Locating the Subject

Your subjects are tip and Juan. Did you select shoe- lace? That word appears in a description — the prepositional phrase of the shoelace. The subject is never part of a prepositional phrase.

The verb in this sentence is is. When you ask who is? you have no answer. When you ask what is? the answer is jumping. Yes, the subject looks like a verb! In fact, it could be part of a verb in a different sentence. In this sentence, though, jumping is a noun and the subject of the sentence. If you answered jumping on the trampoline, don’t worry. You just added on the description attached to jumping. The subject is still there, so your answer is acceptable.

The verb in this question is does taste. Ask the usual questions — who does taste? what does taste? The answer is new brand of peanut butter. In that expression, one word (brand) is key and the rest (new, of peanut butter) are descriptions. The subject is brand. If you answered the new brand of peanut butter, you added the descriptions to the subject, but count your answer as correct because it includes the subject.

Follow the usual procedure to find the real subject in this sentence. Locate the verb, in this case sat, and ask who sat? and what sat? The second question tells you that four large statues of historical figures sat. Okay, time to dig the subject out of that long list of words. Ignore the descriptions (four, large, of historical figures) and you’re left with ­statues, the true subject. If you answered four large statues of historical figures, count your answer as correct because it includes the subject.

The verb in this sentence is circled. When you ask who circled? you may think the answer is tourists. Look more closely at the sentence. True, the tourists moved, but they moved because they were on the bus. Go back to the verb and ask what circled? Now the answer is clear: the bus circled. The subject is bus. By the way, full of delighted tour- ists is a prepositional phrase, which never contains the subject of a sentence.

The pronoun each is the subject here, and of the coffee cups is a description clarifying the meaning of each. (In grammar terminology, cups is the object of a preposition and not eligible to be a subject.) The verb is has, and when you ask what has? the answer is each has. If you answered each of the coffee cups, your answer is acceptable because the real subject, each, is included with its descriptions.

The verb in this sentence is land. Ask your question: Who land? The answer, in long form, is both of the parakeets. Now take away the description (of the parakeets, a prepo- sitional phrase) and you’re left with the subject, the pronoun both. Parakeets, by the way, can’t be a subject because in this sentence it functions as the object of the prepo- sition of. If you answered both of the parakeets, your answer is acceptable because the real subject, both, is included with its descriptions.

**Allison, friend**
The main verb in this sentence is parted. You may have detected two other verb forms, snarling and walking. In this sentence those verb forms function as descriptions. Okay, ask the question: Who parted? The answer is Allison and her former friend Pete. Now you have to excavate the real subjects. Cross out the descriptions (her, former) and the conjunction (the joining word and). You can also cross off Pete because in this sen- tence, Pete and friend are the same person. The first one in the sentence, friend, is the subject. The second, Pete, is an appositive — the grammar term for an equivalent. An appositive isn’t a subject.

**apartment, townhouse**
The word either is tricky. In some situations it’s a pronoun, but when it’s paired in a sentence with or, both the either and the or are conjunctions (joining words). In an either/or sentence — and also in a neither/nor sentence — the subjects are linked by these conjunctions. In this sentence, the subjects are apartment and townhouse. The verb is will please. When you ask who will please? and what will please?, you discover the apartment and townhouse.

**dog, that, I**
Before you can locate the subjects, you have to untangle the statements in this sen- tence. You have three: (1) The dog is over there; (2) that should win the contest; (3) I believe. Now zero in on each statement separately. In the first, the verb is is. When you ask who is? the answer is the dog is. Dog is your first subject. Now go to the second statement. The verb is should win. Who should win? Your answer is the pronoun that. Did you answer dog again? The logic is understandable, but the grammar is clear. The pronoun that replaces dog in the second statement. The subject of should win is that. The third statement is easy. Who believes? I believe. The subject is I. As always, the key to untangling all the statements is to identify the verbs and ask the usual subject questions.

This sentence is easier to figure out if you cross out the prepositional phrase, along with her mother. (It’s a description.) Now the verb, spoke, pops out. Who spoke? Courtney spoke. True, your reading comprehension skills may have told you that both Courtney and her mother spoke, but the word and isn’t in the sentence. Because mother is the object of the preposition along with, it can’t function as a subject.

**truck, which**
To find the subjects of this sentence more easily, untangle the two statements the sen- tence contains: (1) The fire truck speeds through the intersection and (2) which is head- ing to a blaze downtown. Now analyze each statement separately. In the first statement, the verb is speeds. What speeds? The truck. In the second statement, the noun truck has been replaced by a pronoun, which. The verb is is heading. Ask your question: What is heading? The answer is which. Did you choose truck for both verbs? That’s a common mistake, because which represents truck. However, when one subject works for two verbs, the verbs are joined by a conjunction such as and or but.

**V: opens, allows; S: Anna. (Every morning Anna opens the gate and allows her poodle to**
play in the yard.) The sentence has two action verbs (to open and to allow). You must stay in the present tense, so you have two possible for each verb — open or opens and allow or allows. First, ask your subject questions without worrying about which form you need. When you ask who open or opens? and who allow or allows? the answer is Anna. Now you know you have a singular subject (Anna), which matches with the singular verbs, opens and allows.

The sentence contains one verb, which must be in past tense. Therefore your options are was and were. Ask your subject questions without worrying about which form you need. When you ask who was or were? you get no answer. Now ask what was or were? The answer is bottle. (The other words attached to bottle are all descriptions. You can ignore them. In case you’re curious about grammar terms, large-sized is an adjective and of my favorite shampoo is a prepositional phrase.) You have a singular subject (bottle), which matches with the singular verb, was. If you included the descriptions, large-sized and of my favorite shampoo, your answer is still acceptable, so long as you included bottle, the real subject.

needy children.) The verb to plan must be in present progressive tense, so your choices are is planning and are planning. Ask your subject question: Who is or are planning? The answer is Alicia and I. In English, as well as in math, one plus one equals two. So add Alicia and I and you end up with two people, a plural subject, which must match the plural verb form are planning.

Divide this sentence into its two component parts and work on each one separately. The first part is Was or Were Hank pleased. Hank is singular, so you need was, a singu- lar verb form.

223.
**V: were singing, broke; S: Matthew, I, voices. (Matthew and I were singing every single**
song until our voices broke from overuse.) Take each part of the sentence separately. The first blank offers two options in the past progressive tense, was singing and were singing. Ask your subject question: Who was or were singing? The answer is Matthew and I, a plural subject because you have two people. Therefore, you need the plural verb, were singing. Onward to the second part of the sentence: Who broke? The answer is voices broke. There you go: You have two verbs, were singing and broke, and three subjects, Matthew, I, and voices. By the way, broke is the past-tense verb form for both singular and plural subjects. Convenient, right?

**V: is, is; S: ham and cheese, salad. (Ham and cheese is my favorite sandwich, but salad is a**
more nutritious choice.) When foods form one dish or sandwich (peanut butter and jelly, for example, or rice and beans), the dish or sandwich is considered one, singular item. Therefore, when you ask what is or are? to find the answer for the first blank, your answer is ham and cheese, a singular subject that takes a singular verb, is. When you ask the same ques- tions for the second blank, you get salad is — both singular forms.

**V: is; S: problem. (“Your problem is 17 unexcused absences,” commented the teacher as**
she explained why the student was scheduled for detention.) This sentence revolves around a form of the verb to be, a linking verb that acts as a sort of “equal sign” in the sentence. If you were writing this sentence as a math prob- lem, you’d have “problem = absences.” You may notice that the first part of the “equa- tion” is singular (problem) but the second part is plural (absences). So which one governs the verb? The first one. In this type of sentence, location is everything.

228.
**V: influences, vote; S: Politics, senators. (Politics influences much of the debate on that**
issue, but the senators from that state always vote according to their consciences.) The word politics appears to be plural because it ends in the letter s. However, it’s sin- gular. Therefore, you should pair it with the singular verb form influences. In the second blank, your choices are votes and vote. Ask your question: Who vote or votes? The answer is senators vote — a plural subject-verb combination.

**V: is going; S: John. (John, not his friends, is going to attend the ceremony.)**
The expression not his friends is a distraction in this sentence. Notice the commas sur- rounding it? Imagine that you can lift the expression out of the sentence. Now your task is easier. The choices for present progressive include is going and are going. Time for your question: Who is going? The answer: John is going. The singular subject John matches the singular verb is going.

230.
**V: offers, are; S: he, any. (Any of the solutions he offers to the panel are acceptable.)**
This sentence has two parts, one tucked inside the other. When you untangle them, the answer is easier to determine. The tucked-in part is he (offers/offer) to the panel. The outer part is any of the solutions (is/are) acceptable. In the tucked-in part, you have he offers, a singular subject and verb that you find with the usual questions (Who offers or offer? He offers. The singular subject he matches the singular verb offers.) In the outer portion of the sentence, the pronoun any is plural because the word it refers to (solu- tions) is plural. (Remember that any can be either singular or plural depending upon the word that it refers to.) Once you know that any is plural in this sentence, you can choose the plural verb are right away.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

232.
**V: comes; S: Most. (Most of the salt in those diets comes from natural sources.)**
The pronoun most can be either singular or plural depending upon the word it refers to. In this sentence, most refers to salt, a singular word. Therefore, most is a singular subject that pairs nicely with the singular verb comes. If you selected salt or diets as subjects, you forgot one important fact: The object of a preposition can’t be a subject. If you answered most of the salt in those diets, count your answer as correct because the true subject, most, is included with the descriptions.

**V: are drooping; S: two, three. (Two or three of the plants with red leaves are drooping to**
the ground because of the drought.) To crack this sentence, ignore the distractions — the prepositional phrases of the plants and with red leaves. Now ask your questions: Who is or are drooping? What is or are drooping? Your answer is two or three. The numbers two and three function as sub- jects here. They are plurals, so they need the plural verb are drooping.

**V: seems; S: study. (The study of economics seems interesting, but I have never taken any**
courses about this subject.) Cross off the prepositional phrase (of economics), which distracts you from the true subject-verb pair. Now focus on what’s left: the study (seems/seem) interesting. Study is singular, so you need the singular verb form seems.

235.
**V: has been, expect; S: hours, I. (Two hours of homework has been my usual amount, but I**
expect to spend more time on my studies next year.) When you speak about an amount of time, the amount is singular. Therefore, even though two hours appears to be plural, it’s actually singular because it’s one amount. Now ask the questions: Who has been? What have been? The answer is two hours or hours, which in this sentence is a singular subject and must pair with the singular verb form has been. The second part of the sentence is easy: Who expect or expects? The answer is I expect.

236.
**V: plays; S: girl, boy. (Every girl and boy in the kindergarten plays with the plastic blocks,**
not the wooden ones.) The word every has the power to change the meaning of the sentence. No matter what follows it — even something that appears plural such as girl and boy — the word every creates a singular expression. Why? The logic is that every makes you consider the members of the group one by one. Every is not a pronoun and can’t be a subject. Therefore, when you ask who play or plays? the answer is girl and boy, which is singular because the expression is preceded by every. Isn’t English a strange language?

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

237.
**V: is, makes; S: girl, who. (That little girl is the only one of the dancers who makes friends**
easily.) The first part of this sentence is easy. The subject, girl, pairs with the singular form is. The second portion is tricky, as are all sentences that refer to a group and a member of the group. These sentences contain the statements the only one of the (insert group name) or one of the (insert group name), followed by who, which, or that. The key is to think about the meaning of the who/which/that statement. In this sentence, the who statement is about making friends easily. When you apply your reading comprehension skills, you see that only one person is in that category. Therefore, who represents girl, a singular noun. Because who is singular, it requires a singular verb, makes.

238.
**V: is, looks; S: dollars, which. (A thousand dollars is too much to pay for that broken-down**
car, which looks like a rusty bucket.) Amounts of money function as singular subjects, unless you’re talking about the pieces of metal or paper that make up our currency. When you ask what is or are? for the first part of the sentence, the answer is thousand dollars, which looks plural but is actually singular. Therefore, you need the singular verb is, paired with the singular subject dol- lars or thousand dollars. (Either choice is fine.) Now check out the second part of the sentence. Ask the question what look or looks? The answer is the pronoun which. Because which refers to the singular noun car, it’s a singular subject and needs the sin- gular verb looks.

**V: have, is; S: Ginger, aunts, landlord. (Neither Ginger nor her aunts have keys to the**
house, but the landlord is able to supply an extra set.) The paired conjunctions (joining words) neither/nor follow a simple rule: The subject that is closest to the verb is the one to match. In this sentence, aunts is closer to the blank than Ginger. (Why focus on Ginger and aunts? Ask the question who has or have? The answer is Ginger and aunts, which are the subjects.) Because aunts is plural, you need the plural verb form, have. Moving to the second blank, your choices are are, is, and am — all present-tense forms of to be. Ask who are? who is? what am? and the answer is landlord is.

**V: is selling, are; S: Shelby, that. (Shelby is selling me one of the cars that are energy**
efficient.) This sentence contains two separate statements: (1) Shelby is selling me one of the cars and (2) that are energy efficient. The first portion of this sentence is easy: Shelby (singu- lar subject) pairs with is selling (singular verb). The second portion of the sentence is harder. The key is the pronoun that, which begins a statement about energy-efficient cars. Your reading comprehension skills tell you that more than one car falls into the energy-efficient category, and Shelby is selling one of them. Because more than one car is energy-efficient, that is plural and pairs with the plural verb are.

# Chapter 5
## Coming to a Clear Agreement: Pairing Pronouns and Antecedents
Pronouns are like socks. They have to fit perfectly, because if they don’t, you spend the - day walking around with a lump around your toes or pulling up a too-short heel. They - also have to match: no green and blue mixing allowed! Pronouns are stand-ins for other - nouns or pronouns — their antecedents. Don’t worry about the terminology. Just be sure - to select the correct pronoun. In this chapter you find practice for every situation likely to - arise in matching pronouns to antecedents correctly and clearly.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that develop these skills:
✓	Identifying pronouns and their antecedents
✓	Pairing singular and plural pronouns with the appropriate antecedents
✓	Matching the gender of pronouns and antecedents
✓	Ensuring that the antecedent of every pronoun is clear

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	To determine whether you’re using the proper pronoun, first identify the antecedent.
✓	Singular pronouns take the place of singular nouns or other singular pronouns.
✓	Plural pronouns take the place of plural nouns or other plural pronouns.
✓	Match masculine pronouns to masculine nouns, and feminine pronouns to feminine
nouns. Use neuter pronouns for objects and ideas (it, those, and the like).
✓	Some personal pronouns refer to the speaker (I, me, we, and so forth) or to the person
addressed (you, your, for example). These pronouns have no antecedent in the sen-
tence. Other pronouns that refer to an undetermined person or thing (such as whatever
or something) may also lack an antecedent in the sentence.
✓	Pronouns must express only one meaning. If the reader can’t grasp the pronoun-
antecedent relationship, you have to reword the sentence.

## Identifying Pronouns and Their Antecedents
### 241–250 Identify each pronoun in the sentence as well as the word(s) the pronoun replaces (the antecedent). 

#### Note: More than one pronoun may refer to the same antecedent, and sometimes a pronoun has no antecedent in the sentence.

The personal pronoun I (as well as the plural we) refer to the person or people speak- ing, so you won’t find an antecedent in the sentence for I (as in this sentence) or we (which doesn’t appear in this sentence). The possessive pronoun my refers to the per- sonal pronoun I. The singular, masculine pronoun his refers to dog, and the singular, neuter pronoun it refers to bone.

255.
**their, it (The audience sat in their seats, patiently waiting for the performance to begin,**
but it was delayed.) This sentence is a little tricky. The audience appears to be singular, but it’s actually a collective noun because an audience is made up of many different people. The audi- ence can, as a whole, be seated, but once you mention seats, you have to think about the individuals, the component parts of the collective noun audience. With more than one individual, you need the plural, possessive pronoun, their. The second blank is sim- pler: The singular, neuter pronoun it works perfectly as a replacement for performance.

The personal pronoun I refers to the speaker, and the plural pro- noun them refers to athletes.

**his or her, her (Everyone in the restaurant wants his or her meal right away, but Chef**
Helen will cook at her own pace.) The pronoun everyone appears plural, but it’s a singular word that must be matched by another singular pronoun. Because you don’t know whether the diners are men, women, or a mixed group, his or her is best. The pronoun in the second blank refers to one woman (Chef Helen), so you need a singular, feminine pronoun, her.

**III. (The government hopes to avoid war because of its high cost in both money and lives.)**
In Sentence I (In the paper it says that war may break out within the next two days) you have a double subject — paper it. Why repeat? Beginning the sentence with The paper says that . . . is clearer. Sentence II (In an article in the paper it says that soldiers will report for duty tomorrow) doesn’t double up subjects as Sentence I does, though, because article and paper are objects of prepositions, not subjects. However, the second sentence has a different problem: it has no clear antecedent, because both arti- cle and paper are possible. (The correct version would be An article in the paper says that soldiers will report for duty tomorrow.) In the last sentence, its clearly refers to war. Only Sentence III is correct.

In Sentence I (The Yankee was a great hitter, but the other team’s star was better at it), it could refer to batting, if only batting were in the sentence. It isn’t! Therefore, Sentence I is wrong. In Sentence II, they refers to shades, so that sentence is correct. Sentence III correctly pairs lights with which.

# Chapter 6
## Solving the Case (of Pronouns)
You don’t have to be a detective to know that pronouns — the part of speech that takes - the place of nouns — are important. The issue with pronouns is that their form sometimes - changes depending upon how they’re used in the sentence — a quality known as case. In - this chapter you work on all three cases — subject (also known as subjective or nominative - case), object (also known as objective case), and possessive.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that involve these concepts:
✓	Identifying pronouns as subject, object, or possessive
✓	Choosing the correct pronoun case according to the pronoun’s role in the sentence

### What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Subject pronouns act as subjects, the who or what performing the action or in the state
of being expressed in the sentence.
✓	Subject pronouns also follow linking verbs (forms of the verb to be or verbs that
express sensory information, such as to sound, to feel, and so forth).
✓	Object pronouns act as objects: direct objects, indirect objects, and objects of a preposi-
tion or verbal (a verb form not functioning as a verb). You don’t need to worry about what
type of object you have, as long as you know that the pronoun is acting as an object. An
object answers the questions whom? or what? after a verb, preposition, or verb form.
✓	Possessive pronouns express ownership. When you say my book or our vacation, my
and our are possessive pronouns.
✓	Some possessive pronouns function as subjects, objects, or other roles commonly
played by nouns. In that book is mine, mine is a possessive pronoun because it
expresses ownership, even though in this sentence it’s acting as a subject complement.
✓	You may run across a verb form ending in -ing that acts as a noun — a gerund, in
English-teacher terminology. The pronoun preceding it is possessive. For example, in
this sentence the possessive pronoun my precedes the gerund swimming: The coach
doesn’t like my swimming, but he can’t stop me!
✓	Don’t confuse possessive pronouns with contractions — shortened forms of other words.
It’s means “it is,” and its is a possessive pronoun. No possessive pronoun has an apostrophe.

## Sorting Subject, Object, and Possessive Pronouns
### 271–285 Identify the underlined pronouns as subject (S), object (O), or possessive (P) pronouns.

**S, O, S, O (As they built the shelter, the guides told us to watch carefully, in case we ever**
had to erect a hut like it.) They is a subject pronoun, acting in this sentence as the subject of the verb built. Us is an object pronoun, which in this sentence serves as the indirect object of the verb told. (In case you’re curious, the direct object is to watch carefully.) Next up is the subject pronoun we, which functions as the subject of the verb had. Finally, it is an object pro- noun acting as the object of the preposition like.

**S, S, O, S (Doreen and I caught five fish yesterday, but she threw them back into the water**
because we don’t like to eat salmon.) I is a subject pronoun — specifically, the subject of the verb caught. She is also a sub- ject pronoun, paired with the verb threw. Next you see an object pronoun, them, which is the direct object of the verb threw. Last but not least, we is a subject pronoun, acting as the subject of do like. (What happened to the negative? The contraction don’t is actually do not, and not is an adverb, not part of the verb.)

**S, S, S, S (I know it was she on the phone because I always recognize voices.)**
The first verb in this sentence is know, and the subject pronoun I is its subject. Then you run into a linking verb, was. Think of a linking verb as an equal sign in a math prob- lem. What comes before and after a linking verb should be equal. Therefore, both it and she are subject pronouns. The first one, it, is the actual subject and the second, she, is the subject complement. Now you have another verb, recognize. I is the subject pro- noun acting as the subject of recognize.

**P, S, S (Lulu’s parents hate her adding an extra course because they think she is too busy**

(In technical grammar terminology, her is a possessive attached to the gerund adding.) They is a subject pronoun, acting as the subject of the verb think. She is also a subject pronoun, acting as the subject of the verb is.

**S, P, P (After Helen had examined the clothing thoroughly, she tried on a coat and**
declared, “Mine is more stylish and warmer,” as she threw his away.) The subject pronoun she is the subject of the verb tried in this sentence. Both mine and his are possessive pronouns here; mine refers to Helen’s coat, and his to an unknown male. By the way, the possessive pronoun mine is the subject of the verb is, but it’s possessive because it expresses ownership.

(The con- traction didn’t is short for did not, but not is an adverb, not part of the verb itself.) The possessive pronoun yours acts as the subject of the verb was, but it’s still possessive because it expresses ownership.

**P, P, O, S (The director loved your jumping in front of the runaway horse in the final**

Finally, you have the subject pronoun you working as the subject of the verb were. (Are you wondering what the direct object of told is? The direct object of told is to look, an infinitive.)

**P, S, P, P (Their pitcher has a better record than I, but my team wins more games than his.)**
The possessive pronoun their is attached to the noun pitcher. To figure out the next pronoun, you need to add an implied word: do. Tuck that word into the sentence and you have than I do. Now you see that the subject pronoun I is the subject of the verb do. You come across another possessive pronoun, my, which is attached to the noun team. Lastly, you have to add in some implied words again. Think of the sentence as ending with than his team does. His is a possessive pronoun attached to the noun team.

**his, their, they (Scott and his fellow racewalkers swing their arms as they hurry to the**

**He, I, they (He and I will order food for 100 people, in case they all come.)**
The subject noun David may be replaced by the subject pronoun he. You also need a subject pronoun to refer to the speaker, and I fits perfectly. (Did you choose myself?

290.
**me, you, its (Everyone but me plays the guitar, but you understand the instrument and its**
construction too.) The word but is usually a conjunction — a joining word — but the first time you see it in this sentence, it’s a preposition. Prepositions need objects, and me is an object pro- noun. (If you selected myself, you made a common mistake. The -self pronouns work only for emphasis, as in I myself will do it, or to express action that doubles back, as in I asked myself why I bother with grammar.) You is the subject pronoun acting as the sub- ject of the verb understand. In the third blank, go for the possessive its. The contraction it’s, by the way, means it is and isn’t a possessive pronoun.

Questions are easy to figure out if you rearrange the words into statement format: ____did hit ___ and run around ____. Now you can see that you need a subject for the verb did hit, so select the subject pronoun he for the first blank. The ball is a thing, so the pronoun it, which works as either a subject or an object, replaces the ball. Last, you need the object pronoun them to replace the bases and serve as the object of the preposition around.

**him, their, it (Seeing Laura and him pulling their wagon up the hill was impressive,**
because it was very steep.) The subject of the sentence (seeing) is a verb form used as a noun — a gerund. A gerund may have an object, and this one has two — Laura and James. The object pro- noun him replaces James as the object of the gerund, seeing. For the second blank you need a possessive that refers to two people, and their is perfect. Next, you have the subject pronoun it, referring to the hill and acting as the subject of the verb was.

**him, I, ourselves (To satisfy him, Mr. Palgrove, Beth and I handed in an excellent paper**

In the second blank, place the subject pro- noun I to represent the speaker and to act as the subject of the verb handed. Last, the pronoun ourselves substitutes for Beth and the speaker and acts as the object of the preposition by. Did you choose us for the last blank? If so, you fell into a trap. Us is an object pronoun, and you need an object of the preposition. However, because the pro- noun refers back to the subject, the pronoun ourselves is more appropriate.

Questions are easy to figure out if you rearrange the words into statement format: _____ do know the boy _____ designed the sailboat for _____. As you see, you need a subject for the verb do know, so select the subject pronoun they for the first blank. Now you need a subject pronoun to act as the subject of the verb designed. One possi- bility is he, but then you end up with a run-on sentence, because two complete thoughts are stuck together: Do they know the boy? and He designed the winning sail- boat for Henry. The solution is the pronoun who, which relates the statement about design to the question about knowing the boy. Who is a subject pronoun, perfect for the role of subject of the verb designed. Finally, insert an object pronoun, him, into the last blank to act as the object of the preposition for. Did you choose himself for the second blank because you assumed that a word, that, was implied? Count yourself right, because this sentence makes sense: Do they know [that] the boy himself designed the winning sailboat for Henry?

You could plug in it to represent the test, but then you’d have a run-on sentence, because two complete thoughts would be present: All of us students worried about the test and the test was scheduled for us.

The -self pronouns work only when the action expressed by the verb doubles back, as in she told herself not to panic. For the third blank, you need another subject pronoun for the verb recognized.

Change this question to a statement and your choice is clearer: Jason and _____ are the funniest comedians in the show, or _____ is. The secret here is the linking verb are. Both sides of the linking verb require subject pronouns. Therefore, Frank becomes he and Valerie becomes she.

**himself, he, it (Jeff told himself that he would understand the question and write it**
quickly.) When the action doubles back on the subject, a -self pronoun is justified. Such is the situation here: Jeff told himself, not someone else. Next up is a subject pronoun, he, that functions as the subject of the verbs would understand and write. Lastly, the neuter pronoun it represents the noun essay.

**her, he, me, he, me (Mack told the secret to Al and her before he told me, but he gave me**
more details.) In the first blank you need the object pronoun her to act as the object of the preposi- tion to. In the second blank, the subject pronoun he is the subject of the verb told. Now you need an object pronoun (me) to act as the object of the verb told, a subject pro- noun (he) as the subject of the verb gave, and finally an object pronoun (me) for the verb gave.

**she, they, her (Jeremy is as nervous as she when they visit her parents.)**
The secret to this sentence is that some of the words are understood, not stated. Add in the implied words, and your choice of pronouns is easier: Jeremy is as nervous as Gloria is. Gloria is the subject of the implied verb is, so you need a subject pronoun (she) to replace Gloria. Next you need a plural subject pronoun (they) to represent Jeremy and Gloria. For the last blank, the feminine, singular, possessive pronoun her replaces Gloria’s.

312.
**my, her, me (Elizabeth hates my calling her “Liz” and has forbidden me to do so.)**
This sentence contains what English teachers call a gerund — a verb form ending in -ing that is used as a noun. Before a gerund, you need a possessive form. You can forget about English-teacher terminology and solve this sentence with logic: Elizabeth doesn’t hate me; she hates being called “Liz.” The possessive pronoun my tilts your attention to calling her “Liz,” where it should be. Next you need an object pronoun, her, to act as the object of the gerund. (Gerunds, though they function as nouns, keep some of the properties of verbs, including the ability to have an object.) In the last blank, the object pronoun me is the object of the verb has forbidden.

**who, its (Fran, who Charlie thinks should take a course in public speaking, is not open to**
its subject matter.) This sentence contains several different ideas. Untangle them and the pronoun choices become easier. Start by pairing each verb with its subject. In this list, I’ve underlined the verbs in each idea: (1) Fran is not open to the course’s subject matter (2) _____ should take a course in public speaking (3) Charlie thinks. Can you see that you need a subject for should take? Bingo: The subject pronoun who does the job. The second blank is simple; opt for the possessive pronoun its to replace the singular possessive noun, course’s.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

314.
**me, your, I (Between you and me, no one is happier about your getting a new puppy**
than I.) The preposition between calls for an object pronoun, so me is the one you want. (Between you and I is a common expression, but it’s also wrong.) For the second blank you need a possessive pronoun because the happiness is caused by getting a new puppy, not by a person. The possessive pronoun your shifts the attention of the reader or listener to the action. This construction is, in English-teacher terms, “possessive attached to a gerund.” Now for the last blank. A word (am) is implied, but not stated in the sentence. The sentence, with that word added, explains that no one is happier . . . than I am. The subject pronoun I is the subject of the implied verb am.

**you, whoever, he (Don’t you think whoever wants to succeed should study harder than**
he?) The person or people being spoken to are always referred to as you, which is conve- niently correct for both singular and plural situations. When you refer to anyone in a group, you’re in whoever/whomever territory. Here you need a subject for wants, so go for the subject pronoun whoever. To solve the third blank, add the implied verb does to the end of the sentence, which then reads harder than _____ does. Clearly you need a subject pronoun for the verb does, and he fills the gap.

316.
**I, whoever, my (Alex and I plan to read the article and respond to whoever has complaints**
about my work.) The verb plan has a compound subject, Alex and I. (I is a subject pronoun and always refers to the speaker.) The next verb in the sentence is has, so you need a subject pronoun, whoever, to act as the subject of has. Did you choose whomever because you saw the preposition to? If so, you fell into a trap. True, to needs an object, but in this sentence its object is whoever has complaints about my work. The last blank is easy. The possessive pronoun my is attached to work.

**whoever, I, it (The letter tucked into the bottle began, “To whoever finds this bottle”;**
I read it eagerly.) Your choices for the first blank are whoever and whomever. Because the sentence begins with the preposition to, you may be tempted to select the object pronoun whomever. Nope! The verb finds needs a subject, whoever. In case you’re wondering about the object of the preposition: It’s the entire clause, whoever finds this bottle. On to the second blank: Here you need the subject pronoun I to act as the subject of the verb read. The object pronoun it finishes the sentence, functioning as the object of the verb read.

**whomever, him, them (When Jason told you to ask whomever you like to work on the**
project with him, did you choose them?) Break this question into parts to make your life easier. The first part is fine as it is, so direct your attention to the second part. The verb there is like, and the subject of like is you. You don’t need a subject or a subject complement, so the answer can’t be who- ever. In fact, you need an object — whomever. The preposition with requires an object pronoun, so the singular, masculine, object pronoun him fits well here. Now look at the last part. Change it into a statement: you did choose _____. The verb is did choose, the subject is you, and the blank should be filled with an object pronoun, them.

# Chapter 7
## Forming Complete Sentences
In court, witnesses must swear to tell “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the - truth.” In grammar, you have to write “the sentence, the whole sentence, and nothing but - the sentence.” In other words, complete sentences rule — not fragments (partial or incom- - plete sentences) or run-ons (two or more ideas improperly thrown together). In this chapter - you practice identifying and creating complete and grammatically correct statements and - questions.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that involve these skills:
✓	Recognizing whether a sentence is complete or incomplete
✓	Joining two or more ideas correctly
✓	Editing fragments and run-ons to create complete sentences

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Every sentence must express a complete thought.
✓	Be sure the sentence has a matching subject-verb pair.
✓	All sentences need endmarks — periods for statements, question marks for questions,
and exclamation points for exclamations.
✓	Don’t assume that short sentences are incomplete and long sentences are complete.
Meaning, not length, is your guide.
✓	Semicolons (;) and conjunctions such as and, but, or, nor, for, since, because, where, when,
and others link one clause (a grammatical unit containing a subject-verb pair) to another.
✓	Relative pronouns — who, whoever, whom, whomever, that, and which — relate one
idea to another, usually by replacing a noun. For example, in this sentence the relative
pronoun that replaces book: The book that I bought is very heavy.
✓	Adverbs such as however, consequently, therefore, then, also, nevertheless, and others
may not link one complete sentence to another. Use these words to add meaning, but
be sure that you use a semicolon or a conjunction between the sentences.

**I. (At the army museum, many exhibits caught our attention.)**
Sentence I is complete because it has a subject-verb pair (exhibits is the subject and caught is the verb). It also has an endmark (a period). Sentence II (At the army museum, many exhibits caught our attention) lacks an endmark, and Sentence III (At the army museum, many exhibits catching our attention) has a subject (exhibits) but no matching verb. The -ing form of a verb never functions as a verb unless a form of the verb to be is attached. Therefore, many exhibits are catching our attention would work, but not catch- ing alone.

Chewing his food quickly and then running off to play is a description, not a verb to match dog, the subject. The second sentence is perfect: It has a subject-verb pair (dog chewed and ran), a complete thought, and an endmark (a period). The third choice (The little dog chewed his food quickly and then ran off to play) lacks an endmark. Therefore, only Sentence II is complete.

Nevertheless (as in Sentence I: Jack’s suit is old, nevertheless, he still looks good in it) and however (as in Sentence II: Jack’s suit is old, however, he still looks good in it) seem to be important, strong words — and they are! Unfortunately, neither is a conjunction and therefore neither may join two complete thoughts. Only Sentence III is grammati- cally legal, because the semicolon is powerful enough to link two complete thoughts.

**All of the sentences**
In Sentence I (The mechanic checked the steering wheel, which was fine, but he said that the brakes were defective), the conjunction but links two complete thoughts (the mechanic checked the steering wheel, which was fine and he said that the brakes were defective). Tucked inside each of those statements is still another statement (which was fine in the first half of the sentence and that the brakes were defective in the second half of the sentence). Those tucked-in statements are linked to the main idea by rela- tive pronouns, which and that. Relative pronouns relate one idea to another, so every- thing is fine in Sentence I. Sentence II (The mechanic checked the steering wheel, which was fine, and then he said that the brakes were defective) relies on the conjunction and to join ideas, and Sentence III (The mechanic checked the steering wheel, which was fine, although he said that the brakes were defective) gives the joining job to although, another conjunction. Because the ideas in these sentences are joined by conjunctions, they are all correct.

## Correcting Run-Ons and Fragments
### 347–361 What changes, if any, should be made to the underlined words in order to create a complete sentence?

347.	 Teresa <u> holding the tray</u>  as I placed the glasses on it.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

347.
**held the tray (Teresa held the tray as I placed the glasses on it.)**
The original statement is a fragment because there’s no true subject-verb pair. Insert held the tray and you have Teresa held, a fine subject-verb match. Did you opt for was holding? That answer is also fine. If you selected holds, you’re wrong, because the verb in the second portion of the sentence (placed) is in past tense, so a present-tense verb (holds) is inappropriate for the first part of the sentence.

**box. Their contributions fund (Generous donors drop coins in the box. Their contribu-**
tions fund scholarships.) The original statement is a run-on — two complete ideas jammed together without a proper conjunction or a semicolon. You can make two sentences, placing a period after box and capitalizing their to correct the error. You can also insert a semicolon between box and their or insert a conjunction, such as and.

**No change**
The original is a command directed to Margaret. No change is needed because the sen- tence has a subject-verb pair, you (understood but not stated) and place. All complete and correct! Direct address words, by the way, can roam around. Margaret may appear at the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence without creating any problems.

**The dictionary rested (The dictionary rested on a shelf in the corner.)**
The original statement lacks a subject-verb pair. Change resting to rested and you’re all set, because the subject dictionary pairs well with the verb rested. You can also pair dic- tionary with was resting, rests, will rest, and has rested.

**relaxing, but my aunt prefers (I find knitting relaxing, but my aunt prefers embroidery.)**
The two complete thoughts in the original (I find knitting relaxing and my aunt prefers embroidery) can’t be connected with a simple comma. A semicolon or a conjunction such as but properly links these ideas. You can also correct the original by making two sentences, placing a period after relaxing and capitalizing my. Another possible correc- tion is to use the conjunction although or even though before my aunt.

353.
**were covered (Those mountain peaks were covered with snow even in the summer.)**
The original appears to have a matching subject-verb pair, but mountain peaks aren’t performing the action (covered), so covered is a description, not a verb. Insert were to create a passive-voice verb, and the subject-verb pair works: mountain peaks (subject) were covered (verb). The passive verb allows the subject to receive the action. If you chose are covered, you’re also correct.

The original improperly joins two complete ideas (both commands with the same implied subject, you) with a comma. Nope! Change the comma to a semicolon and you’re fine. You can also place a period after lot and begin a new sentence by capitaliz- ing be. Another possibility is to insert a conjunction (and, for example) before be.

The original has no verb. An easy correction is to add there were. Now the subject of the sentence is pen and pencil and the verb is were. (Surprised? There is an adverb, not a subject noun.) You can correct this sentence in other ways, too. For example, you might insert lay or were before on the desk. The present-tense verb are works also.

**No change**
The underlined portion of the sentence appears to be incomplete because no subject appears and you have only a partial verb. However, the rules of grammar allow you to imply a subject in one portion of the sentence, so long as the subject that appears in the other portion of the sentence is the same as the implied subject. You’re also allowed to imply part of the verb. Here, the implied words between while and swim- ming are Harriet was. The subjects match, so this one is fine as it is. You could also choose Harriet swam and end up with a correct sentence.

# Chapter 8 !
## Moving Beyond the Basics: Adding Descriptions
A complete sentence (see Chapter 7) can be as short as two words: Marjorie raps, for
example. Life would be very boring, though, if you relied only on subjects and verbs
to get your meaning across. Add in some adjectives and adverbs — the descriptive parts of
speech — and your listener or reader perks up. These “extras” give us Marjorie raps often or
Marjorie raps superfast or Little Marjorie raps every single day. In this chapter you practice
with short descriptions — one-word or slightly longer expressions that attach to nouns,
pronouns, verbs, and other adjectives and adverbs.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions in these areas:
✓	Identifying adjectives and adverbs
✓	Selecting the appropriate adjective or adverb for a particular situation
✓	Knowing when to use a or an
✓	Inserting hyphens in compound descriptions. 

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Adjectives describe nouns and pronouns, telling you how many, which one, how much,
or what kind of thing or person you’re talking about.
✓	Adverbs describe verbs, telling you how, when, where, why, or under what conditions
an action or state of being occurs.
✓	Adverbs also describe adjectives and other adverbs, expressing the intensity or degree
of the quality the adverb describes.
✓	The article an precedes a word beginning with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, or u).
A precedes a word beginning with a consonant sound (any letter except the
vowels listed in the preceding sentence).
✓	If two or more words function as one description, you generally hyphenate them, as in
second-place finish, green-and-yellow hat, hard-working waiter, and so forth.

## Distinguishing Between Adjectives and Adverbs
### 362–373 Identify the underlined words (in order) as adjectives (ADJ), adverbs (ADV), or neither (N).

**ADJ, ADV, ADV, ADJ (Be smart. Drive defensively, and you’ll arrive safely and enjoy a**
lovely vacation.) This sentence begins with a command based on a linking verb, be. After a linking verb, you need a word to complete the idea. Ask the usual question, be what? Be smart.

Drive defensively and safely. Defensively and safely are adverbs describing the verb drive. Now examine lovely. It looks like an adverb because it ends in -ly, as many adverbs do.

Therefore, lovely is an adjective describing the noun vacation.

392.
**widely, surely, dismal (The widely seen broadcast was surely helpful to the show’s dismal**
ratings.) The adverb widely describes the adjective seen, in the same way that the adverb surely describes the adjective helpful. The adjective dismal describes the noun ratings.

399.
**an, a, an (an initial impression, a very happy child, an additional payment)**
The words initial and additional begin with vowel sounds, so the article an should pre- cede those words. A precedes very happy child because very begins with a consonant.

400.
**a, an, a (a historic occasion, an important dictionary, a telephone)**
The word historic begins with a consonant, so it should be preceded by a. Surprised? A very long time ago, historic was pronounced differently, as if it began with a vowel. Therefore, you may hear people say an historic occasion, but the more modern expres- sion is a historic occasion. The article an should precede important dictionary, because important begins with a vowel sound. A precedes telephone, which begins with a consonant.

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

401.
**an, a, a (an herb garden, a fir tree, a balcony)**
The word herb, in American usage, has a silent h, so in America it’s preceded by an. (In Britain, the h is pronounced, so a is correct.) Both fir tree and balcony begin with con- sonants, so they’re preceded by a.

403.
**I. and II. (I. self-cleaning oven; II. best-dressed list)**
The words preceding oven and list each form a single description, so I and II are cor- rect. Blue pens (in Phrase III: package of blue-pens) should not be hyphenated, because blue describes pens.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

404.
**I. and II. (I. recently passed law; II. brown-eyed boy)**
Recently describes passed, so no hyphen is needed there. Phrase I is correct. Brown- eyed forms one description of boy, so the hyphen should be present. Phrase II is cor- rect. Because poorly describes expressed, no hyphen is needed. Phrase III (poorly-expressed idea) is incorrect.

405.
**III. (sixth-grade math)**
Is Phrase I (third base coach) referring to the third coach the manager sent to stand near a base, or is it the coach at third base? Without the hyphen, the meaning is unclear, and I is wrong. (Two meanings are possible: The third-base coach stands near third base; the third base-coach is the manager’s choice after his first two selections have left the game.) The adverb very never appears in a hyphenated expression, so Phrase II (very-shallow water) is wrong. Only with Phrase III do you have a winner. Math is described by one phrase, sixth-grade.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

406.
**I. (nine-year-old kid)**
Three words (nine, year, old) form one description of kid, so nine-year-old is correct. In Phrases II (constantly-changing world) and III (nearly-enough candy), the first word is an adverb describing an adjective — a situation that doesn’t call for a hyphen. Therefore, II and III are incorrect.

</details>

III.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

407.
**All of the phrases**
In the first phrase (tension-relieving exercise), two words, tension and relieving, form one description of exercise. In the second phrase (a job well done), the description fol- lows the noun (job) it’s describing, so well done isn’t hyphenated. In Phrase III (newly formed committee), the adverb newly describes formed, so it’s not hyphenated either. Every phrase is correct.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

408.
**None of the phrases**
In the first expression (three-blind mice), each description of mice (three and blind) is separate, so no hyphen is needed. In the second and third expressions (very-happy puppy and less-valid argument), very and less describe the adjectives that follow them (happy and valid). Therefore, they shouldn’t be hyphenated. All the phrases are wrong.

410.
**I. and III. (I. more interesting story; III. extremely difficult problem)**
The words more and extremely are both adverbs describing the adjectives they pre- cede (interesting, difficult). No hyphen is needed for either of these phrases. You do, however, need a hyphen for red-haired in Phrase II (red haired ape), because those words create a single description for ape.

</details>

annual-dental exam


II.

III.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

411.
**II. (language-proficiency test)**
Phrase I (annual-dental exam) doesn’t need a hyphen because each word (annual, dental) describes exam separately. Language and proficiency, on the other hand, form one description of test, so you need a hyphen there. Mostly describes boring, so no hyphen is called for in the third phrase (mostly-boring material). Only Phrase II is correct.

# Chapter 9
# Taking the Long View: Descriptive Phrases and Clauses

As you text or tweet, short descriptions seem like a good idea. (Chapter 8 provides practice with almost everything you need to know about these one- or two-word descriptions, also known as adjectives and adverbs.) Longer descriptive elements — phrases and clauses — may not make it into a tweet, but they’re valuable nonetheless. In this chapter you have a chance to show that you know where to place descriptions — mostly the long form, plus a couple of tricky short descriptions — so that they express your intended meaning.


## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these concepts:

✓	Recognizing the word or words described by phrases and clauses
✓	Placing phrases and clauses so that they are clear and describe the appropriate word

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Prepositional phrases may describe nouns or pronouns (adjective phrases) or verbs
(adverb phrases).
✓	Infinitives and participles may also act as descriptions. Infinitives (to + verb, such as
to meet, to greet, to sleep) may describe nouns, pronouns, or verbs. Participles (the
part of a verb you use with has, have, or had, such as given, driving, and the like) may
describe nouns or pronouns.
✓	Clauses (units of a sentence that contain a subject-verb pair) may describe nouns,
pronouns, or verbs.
✓	To find any sort of adjective, ask these questions: How many? Which one? What kind? To
locate an adverb, ask the following: How? When? Where? Why? Under what conditions?
✓	Every description, no matter how long or short, must be placed as near as possible
to the word it describes. Only, just, almost, and nearly must be placed right before the
word or words they apply to, not earlier in the sentence.
✓	Steer clear of vague descriptions that may describe one or more words in the sentence.
Your meaning must be clear.
✓	When a verbal phrase begins a sentence, it must describe the subject of the sentence.

## Identifying the Words Being Described

The underlined expression is missing a couple of words — an implied subject ­(lumberjack) and verb (was). Add those into the sentence, and you see that an expres- sion containing the subject, lumberjack, doesn’t describe the subject that does appear in the sentence (also lumberjack). Instead, the underlined expression tells you when the lumberjack dropped a few logs. While carrying wood describes the verb, dropped.

## Avoiding Misplaced, Dangling, and Vague Descriptions
### 432–  451 In which of these sentences are the descriptions placed correctly?

432.	 I.

<details>

432.
**II. (The ruby earrings that I wore to the dance rested on the nightstand next to my bed.)**
The key description here is that I wore to the dance. You have to place that description near the word it describes. Logic tells you that the description applies to earrings. In Sentence II, the description follows earrings. In Sentences I (The ruby earrings rested on the nightstand next to my bed that I wore to the dance) and III (The ruby earrings rested on the nightstand that I wore to the dance next to my bed), it appears elsewhere. Only Sentence II is correct.

**I. and II. (I. The crosstown bus filled with holiday shoppers inched slowly through heavy**
traffic. II. Filled with holiday shoppers, the crosstown bus inched slowly through heavy traffic.) Keep your eyes on the description filled with holiday shoppers. Logically, it applies to bus. Sentences I and II place it just after and just before bus, so both are correct. Sentence III (The crosstown bus inched slowly through heavy traffic filled with holiday shoppers) moves it to the end of the sentence — where it improperly describes traffic. The traffic may be the result of holiday shopping, but it isn’t filled with holiday shop- pers. The crosstown bus is.

**II. (Elena has only three children, though she had hoped for a larger family.)**
The key word here is only, which describes the word it precedes. The intended mean- ing of the sentence is only three, not more. Sentence II expresses that idea. In Sentence I (Elena only has three children, though she had hoped for a larger family), only applies to has — not a logical expression. Similarly, in Sentence III (Elena has three children, though she had only hoped for a larger family) only describes had hoped. Elena presum- ably has done more in her life than have children (Sentence I) and hope (Sentence III). She has probably done many things! Only Sentence II is correct.

In II, the scowling is unnecessary. In III, he alarmed unnecessarily. Both II and III are correct.

What broke into a thousand pieces? Not my hands, but the dishes. Only Sentence II places the description near dishes, where it belongs. In the other two choices, my hands are broken. That situation may be possible, but not a thousand pieces!

**II. and III. (II. Running into the woods, Jack avoided the mugger who was standing still**
and pointing a gun. III. Jack, running into the woods, avoided the mugger who was standing still and pointing a gun.) Logic tells you that if the mugger is standing still and pointing a gun, the mugger can’t also be running into the woods. Sentence I (Jack avoided the mugger who was standing still and pointing a gun, running into the woods) expresses that meaning, so it’s wrong. Sentences II and III give the run to Jack, so they are correct.

**II. and III. (II. During the class, Eleanor told me the teacher was boring. III. Eleanor told**
me the teacher was boring during the class.) In Sentence I (Eleanor told me during the class the teacher was boring) the description during the class may apply to either told or was. Because it’s unclear, Sentence I is incorrect. Sentence II clearly expresses the idea that Eleanor told me something during the class. Sentence III goes in the other direction, explaining that the teacher was boring during the class. Because they are clear, Sentences II and III are correct.

**II. and III. (II. When you’re dealing with unreasonable people, making decisions causes**
arguments quickly. III. When you’re dealing with unreasonable people, making quick decisions causes arguments.) In Sentence I (When you’re dealing with unreasonable people, making decisions quickly causes arguments), quickly is between making and causes. The description may refer to either action, so the sentence is unclear — and wrong. Sentences II and III express clear meanings. In II, the arguments pop up fast. In III, the warning is about quick deci- sions. Sentences II and III are correct.

**I. and II. (I. The house Agnes once visited sold for a million dollars. II. The house Agnes**
visited sold for a million dollars once.) In Sentence III (The house Agnes visited once sold for a million dollars), once is between visited and sold. You can’t tell which meaning the writer intends. Sentence I clearly states that Agnes once visited. Sentence II gives the price the house sold for once. Sentences I and II are clear and correct.

**III. (Testifying for the defense, Mr. Jones gave a compelling account of what he had**

Only in Sentence III is Mr. Jones testifying, so only Sentence III is correct. Sentences I (Testifying for the defense, the eyewitness account from Mr. Jones was compelling) and II (Testifying for the defense, Mr. Jones’s eyewitness account was compelling) have the account doing the testifying.

# Chapter 10
## For Better or Worse: Forming Correct Comparisons
While everyone else is dabbing away tears or snapping photos, do you find yourself wondering why wedding vows pledge “for better or worse” instead of “for more good or more bad”? If so, this chapter is for you. Here, you’re challenged to create comparisons of all types — with one word or many. You also identify and correct vague, illogical, or impossible comparisons.

The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that involve the following tasks:
✓	Choosing the correct word(s) to compare two elements (the comparative form, such as
nicer) or three or more elements (the superlative form, such as nicest)
✓	Inserting more, most, less, and least properly
✓	Dealing with irregular comparisons — good, better, best and bad, worse, worst
✓	Identifying words that can’t be compared
✓	Avoiding incomplete and illogical comparisons

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Short words often form positive comparisons by adding -er or -est to the base word,
and if the base word ends in y, you generally change the y to i before adding -er or -est.
✓	Don’t double up: If you add -er or -est, don’t use more or most too.
✓	Use the comparative (-er or more, less) when comparing two elements and the superla-
tive (-est or most, least) when comparing three or more elements.
✓	Absolutes — perfect, unique, and similar concepts — can’t be compared.
✓	Good, bad, well, many, and much are irregular.
✓	All comparisons must be complete and clear.
✓	Use other or else when comparing someone or something to the group that includes
the person or thing being compared.

## Creating Comparative and Superlative Forms
### 452–  476 Which comparisons of the base word are correct?

452.	 Base word: neat Comparisons: neater, more neater, less neat, neatest, least neat

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

452.
**neater, less neat, neatest, least neat**
More neater is wrong because you never combine more and -er. The others are correct. The one-syllable word neat adds -er and -est to create the comparative and superlative forms. All regular negative comparisons use less and least.

</details>

- 
453.	 Base word: close Comparisons: more close, closer, most close, less close, closest

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

453.

455.
**scarier, scariest, least scary**
Two-syllable words such as scary often add -er or -est to form comparisons. When the base word ends with a consonant-y combination (in this case, -ry), you generally change the y to i before adding -er or -est. Never double up, adding these syllables as well as more or most. All regular negative comparisons use less and least.

<details>

**None of the choices**
A trick question! Unique is an absolute that can never be compared. The word means “one of a kind.” The fact that many people say more unique doesn’t make that expres- sion correct. Something is either unique or not. No degrees of uniqueness exist.

475.
**more nearly perfect**
Yes, it’s true that the Founding Fathers of the United States talked about “a more per- fect union,” but if grammar experts had been involved, they would have said “a more nearly perfect union” instead. Why? Perfect is an absolute. You can approach that state, but once you’re there, you can’t be compared.

476.	 Base word: badly Comparisons: badlier, more badlier, badliest, less badliest, worse

<details>

476.
**worse**
The adverb badly forms comparisons irregularly, never employing more or most. You go from badly to worse and then to worst as you intensify the degree of badness. To move in the opposite direction, subtracting intensity, steer clear of less badly or least badly; opt for better or best instead.

## Avoiding Incomplete, ­Illogical, or Vague Comparisons
### 477–501 How should the underlined expression be changed to create a correct comparison? Note: Check the parentheses, if present, for clues to the intended meaning of the sentence.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

477.
**happier than her sister (Alice is happier than her sister.)**

478.
**No change needed**
Although the comparison isn’t spelled out in the original sentence, the meaning is implied. Peter lost his salary when he quit. Because the meaning is clear, the original needs no change. Did you opt for poorer than he had been? Those words also create a good comparison, but their addition isn’t necessary.

**more famous than any other (George Washington may be more famous than any other**
President of the United States.) George Washington, for those of you who slept through history class, was a President of the United States.

482.	 During the boring lecture, five people fell asleep, and Darian snored the loudest.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

482.
**No change needed**
Loud functions as either an adjective or an adverb. In this sentence, it’s an adverb describing snored. Because you’re considering Darian in a group of five, the superlative form, loudest, does the job.

</details>

487.
**than most modern novelists’ books (Ending on page 1,000, that Victorian novel is**
longer than most modern novelists’ books.) A thousand pages is a lot, but people old enough to write novels are longer than, say, the 6-inch thickness of a 1,000-page book. In other words, the original compares a book to people, but you really want to compare a book to other books.

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

492.
**less comprehensible than Alicia’s (Julia’s accent is less comprehensible than Alicia’s.)**
The original sentence compares accent to a person (Alicia). You should compare one accent to another. By changing Alicia to Alicia’s, accent is implied (less comprehensible than Alicia’s accent).

494.
**the messiest in the neighborhood (Marcy loaned money to her friend, whose house is the**
messiest in the neighborhood.) A neighborhood contains more than two houses, so the superlative form, messiest, is called for here.

495.
**less efficient than (Henry’s strategy for achieving a perfect score on the SAT was less effi-**

496.
**the worst one (Of all the minutes in a day, the baby had to pick the worst one to fall**
asleep!) Picture this scenario: Your kid is in the aisle seat of a plane, and after screaming for the first two hours of the flight, he falls asleep. At that exact moment the guy in the window seat needs the restroom. In terms of grammar, you’re comparing one minute to the other 1,439 in the day, so the superlative form, worst, is proper here.

497.
**as heavy as, perhaps even heavier than (My suitcase is as heavy as, perhaps even heavier**
than, yours.) The rule on double comparisons is simple: Each comparison must be complete. In the original sentence, as heavy is part of a comparison. Add as after heavy and the compar- ison is complete: as heavy as. The second comparison, heavier than, is already complete.

498.
**No change needed**
Three people appear in this sentence: George, Mac, and Nelson. Nevertheless, the com- parative form (better) is appropriate here because of the words either/or. With either/ or, you’re comparing George to Mac first and then George to Nelson. In other words, you’re making two separate, two-person comparisons. No change is needed.

**curlier than Anthony’s (Sidney’s hair, before his recent trip to the salon, was curlier than**

✓	Choosing capitals or lowercase letters for dates, seasons, geographical names, and
regions
✓	Selecting capitals for the titles of literary and scientific works and historical eras or
events
✓	Placing capitals in references to school years and courses
✓	Following the rules for capital letters in quotations

## What to Watch out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Proper names and the personal pronoun I are capitalized, as is a title used as a name or
preceding the name of the person holding that title.
✓	Seasons of the year aren’t capitalized, but the names of months and days are.
✓	The proper names of countries, regions, and geographical features are capitalized.
Generic geographical references are in lowercase.
✓	The first letter of a sentence, title, or subtitle is always capitalized. In headline style,
nouns, verbs, and other important words in titles are capitalized; less important words
aren’t. Titles of scientific works generally follow sentence style, capitalizing only the
first word of the title and subtitle, as well as any proper names.
✓	References to God are customarily capitalized.
✓	School years are in lowercase. Subject areas, except for languages or references to
countries, aren’t capitalized. The names of courses are capitalized in headline style.
✓	The first word of a quotation that is connected to a speaker tag (he said, I stated, and so
forth) is capitalized. Quotations inserted into a sentence without a speaker tag begin
with a lowercase letter, unless the first word is a proper name or the pronoun 

I.
 The
second half of an interrupted quotation begins with a lowercase letter.

# Chapter 12
## Exercising Comma Sense: Placing Commas Correctly
A tiny curved line, the comma has more power than most elected officials. It can make your meaning clear or change the meaning of a sentence entirely. Placing commas where they belong isn’t rocket science, but it does require you to notice every detail. In this chapter you practice paying attention to commas and exercising “comma sense.” The Questions You’ll Work On

In this chapter, you work on questions that exercise the following skills:
✓	Punctuating lists with commas and inserting semicolons where needed
✓	Differentiating between essential and nonessential information by inserting commas
✓	Using commas to set off introductory elements and interruptions in the sentence
✓	Creating direct address with commas
✓	Separating clauses with commas and conjunctions

## What to Watch out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Elements of a list are generally separated by commas. The comma before and is
optional, though most people include it.
✓	If items in a list contain commas, use semicolons to separate the items.
✓	Set off nonessential descriptions from the rest of the sentence using commas. Essential
information is not set off by commas.
✓	Nonessential clauses (subject-verb statements) often begin with which. Essential
clauses often begin with that.
✓	Commas set off words in a sentence that interrupt the flow of meaning (direct address,
exclamations, and the like).
✓	When you join one complete sentence to another with a conjunction (and, or, but, for, yet, nor), place a comma before the conjunction.

## Commas in Lists
### 542–556 Punctuate the list by adding commas and semicolons as needed. Note: Some optional commas already appear in the lists.
 
542.	 ham eggs bacon cereal milk, and toast

<details>

545.
**No commas needed**
Surprised? When conjunctions (and, in this list) separate every descriptive word (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), no commas are needed. Ice cream is one food, which is described by vanilla and chocolate and strawberry, so a comma should not be placed between ice and cream.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

546.
**slid, teetered, and fell flat**
The three verbs (slid, teetered, fell) form a list. A comma is required between slid and teetered. The comma preceding and is optional. The last word, flat, describes fell and is not part of the list. Therefore, it’s not separated by a comma from the word it describes.

**the dirty, ripped, faded shoes**

549.
**a constantly changing, mysterious personality**
Articles, such as a in this list, are generally not separated from the list by a comma. No comma separates the last word on the list (mysterious) from the word it describes (personality). Constantly describes changing, so it forms one description. No comma should be inserted between two words that form one description.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

550.
**my oldest, kindest friend and her extremely strict parents**
This short list has two basic elements, friend and parents. No comma should be placed before and in a two-item list. Friend is described by the list my oldest kindest. No comma ever separates a possessive pronoun (such as my or her) from the list it appears in. Oldest and kindest, on the other hand, should be separated by a comma. No comma may appear after kindest and strict because you can’t separate a preceding description from the word it describes (friend and parents). Finally, no comma belongs between extremely and strict, because extremely describes strict.

551.
**became angry, went to the boss, and vented his passionately held beliefs**
On a basic level, this is a three-item list (became, went, vented). Each item is separated by commas, with an optional comma preceding and. The possessive pronoun his should never be set off by commas. Passionately describes held, so those words shouldn’t be separated by a comma either.

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

552.
**algebra, which I hated; geometry, which I loved; and calculus, which I enjoyed**
The three items in this list, at their most basic, are algebra, geometry, and calculus. Each of these items carries a description. The descriptions (which I hated, which I loved, which I enjoyed) are properly divided from the word they describe by commas. Therefore, semicolons are needed to separate the three items on the basic list. Semicolons emphasize the separation between items on the list when commas are present within the items.

- 
553.	 your penetrating unusually creative mind

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

553.
**your penetrating, unusually creative mind**
Possessive pronouns, such as your in this list, aren’t separated from the list by a comma. Don’t place a comma after unusually because unusually describes another item on the list (creative), not mind. In a sense, unusually creative is one element of the list. The final word of the description, creative, should not be separated from the word it describes.

554.
**Peter Walsh, her former sweetheart; Richard Dalloway, her husband; Hugh Whitbread, an**
old friend Semicolons help to separate items in a list when the items contain commas, clarifying where one item begins and another ends. Without semicolons, the reader can’t tell how many items you’re discussing — whether, for example, Peter Walsh and her former sweetheart are the same person or two people, one named and one not. The three people in this list are, therefore, separated by semicolons. The description of each person is separated from the name by a comma.

556.
**five sides, equal in length, width, and height**
Sides has two descriptions — one before (five) and one after (equal). The preceding description (five) should not be cut off from the word it describes by a comma. The description that follows sides, however, is set off by a comma. Now examine the words that come after equal. They form one description. In length, width, and height is a prep- ositional phrase describing equal. The elements of the list (length, width, height) are separated by commas. Note: The comma before and is optional.

**Street, place (The corner of Second Avenue and Fifth Street, where the accident took**
place, now has a stoplight.) By the time you get to the description (where the accident took place), you already know which corner you’re discussing — Second Avenue and Fifth Street. Therefore, the description is nonessential and should be set off from the rest of the sentence by commas.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

560.
**No commas needed**
The statement about five siblings tells you that Alice has more than one cousin. Therefore, which one are you talking about? Alice’s cousin is too general, so the name (Charles) is essential and should not be set off from the rest of the sentence by commas.

563.
**Johnny, cars (Johnny, playing with his toy cars, was not old enough to drive a real vehicle.)**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

565.
**No commas needed**

568.
**blue, color (The office decorated in blue, our state color, displays paintings with patriotic**
themes.) Which office? Who knows? You don’t, until you read the identifier (decorated in blue). The identifier adds essential information, so you don’t want to separate it from office. The description, our state color, is not essential because you already know that you’re talk- ing about the color blue. Therefore, our state color should be set off by commas from the rest of the sentence.

571.	 I didn’t join the club because we’re friends; I am interested in its activities.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

571.
**No commas needed**
To understand this sentence, you have to think of the first part with and without a comma. With a comma, the statement I didn’t join the club is absolute. The speaker, I, is not in the club, and the information because we’re friends is a reason. (Maybe the speaker is afraid to compete with the friend.) Without a comma, the speaker did join the club, but not because we’re friends but rather because the speaker is interested in its activities. The second version makes more sense, so no comma sets off because we’re friends.

572.
**salads, dill (The herb Debby sprinkles on most of her salads, dill, is easy to grow.)**
This sentence presents two problems. Take them one by one. First, which herb are you discussing? You can’t tell until you learn that it’s what Debby sprinkles on her salads. Because that information is essential, no commas surround it. Second, the herb is iden- tified as dill. You’ve already supplied one identifier (Debby sprinkles on her salads), so this one is extra and should be set off by commas.

574.
**you (Sarah won’t slap you, because she avoids violence at all costs.)**
With a comma after you, the next bit of information is extra — just a reason why Sarah won’t slap you. You may want to know the reason, but even if you don’t, you don’t have to brace for a slap. The fact that she avoids violence at all costs means that the first statement is absolute — no exceptions.

575.
**made, Caddyshack (I have seen the funniest film ever made, Caddyshack, about**
30 times.) The funniest film ever made is a personal statement. You may select something else. Within this sentence, however, the funniest film ever made is enough to identify what the speaker is discussing — his or her opinion. Therefore, the name of the film is extra and should be surrounded by commas.

576.
**play (Nearly every student of English literature loves Shakespeare’s best play, Hamlet.)**
Shakespeare’s best play is considered adequate identification in this sentence, so the name of the play is extra information, set off by a comma from the rest of the sentence. Yes, you can argue that a reader may choose King Lear or Romeo and Juliet or another work as Shakespeare’s best play. In the context of the sentence, though, the name isn’t essential.

# Chapter 13
## Little Things That Mean A Lot: Apostrophes and Quotation Marks
A postrophes and quotation marks cause much confusion, but these tiny bits of ink serve a purpose. Apostrophes indicate ownership and omitted letters or numbers. Quotation marks identify words from someone other than the writer. In this chapter you answer questions about the proper placement of apostrophes and quotation marks.

The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions in the following areas:
✓	Placing apostrophes to show ownership by one or more people
✓	Shortening words or numbers with apostrophes
✓	Using apostrophes with expressions of time and money
✓	Distinguishing between quoted and paraphrased material
✓	Situating periods, commas, and other punctuation marks in quoted material, citations,
and titles

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Don’t use an apostrophe to create a plural. (Exceptions to this rule exist, but they’re
not in common use.)
✓	To create a possessive, singular noun, add ’s. To create a possessive, regular plural, add
an apostrophe after the s. To create the possessive form of an irregular plural, add ’s.
✓	In contractions, replace omitted words or numbers with an apostrophe. (A few irregular
contractions, such as won’t for will not, don’t follow this rule.)
✓	Always surround quoted material and titles of short works (poems, short stories, and
the like) with quotation marks.
✓	In Standard American English, single quotation marks appear only when one quotation
nests inside another quotation. Place periods and commas before the closing
quotation mark. Place semicolons and colons after the closing quotation mark.
✓	If you’re quoting a question, the question mark precedes the closing quotation mark.
If the sentence is a question but the quotation isn’t, place the question mark after the
closing quotation mark. Follow the same pattern for exclamation points — before
the closing quotation mark if the quoted words are an exclamation and after the
closing quotation mark if the sentence, but not the quotation, is an exclamation.

**son-in-law’s, deer’s, Martin’s**
To form the possessive of a singular or plural hyphenated noun (son-in-law), add ’s after the last word. Deer is a strange word because it serves as both the singular and plural.

600.
**fish’s, oranges’, Ms. Jones’s**
Fish may be either singular or plural, but either way you form the possessive by adding ’s. Oranges is a regular, plural noun. Form the possessive by adding an apostrophe after the s. Strictly speaking, to form the possessive of a singular noun (Ms. Jones) ending in s, you should add ’s. However, everyone except the most traditional grammarians accepts a simple apostrophe after the final s as a way to form the possessive. Therefore, Ms. Jones’ is also a correct answer.

616.
**Who’d, day’s (Who’d work two weeks for only a day’s pay?)**
The apostrophe signals the contraction who’d, which is short for who would. You need an apostrophe in day’s because the apostrophe replaces of (a day of).

## Distinguishing Between Quotations and Paraphrases
### 617–624 Look at this script, in which two friends discuss a baseball game. Read the sentences following the script. What, if anything, should be surrounded by quotation marks?

Script:
JEFF: Hey, did you go to the game last night?

JANE: Yeah, and I’m glad I did. Did you see Marcus hit in the third inning? It was stupendous! It shot over the left-field wall like a rocket. Were you there?

JEFF: No. I stayed home to do the most boring math homework in the universe. You know what? The teacher didn’t even collect the homework! She didn’t grade it. Isn’t that, like, against the law or something?

- 
617.	 Jane told Jeff that Marcus hit a home run.

618.
**“I stayed home to do the most boring math homework in the universe.”**
Jeff explained is a speaker tag — a short phrase that identifies whose words are quoted in the sentence. The exact words from the script (I stayed home to do the most boring math homework in the universe) should be surrounded by quotation marks.

622.
**No quotation marks needed**
True, a couple of Jeff’s words (grade, the homework) appear in the sentence. However, they aren’t arranged the way they are in the script. Because they’re paraphrased but not directly quoted, no quotation marks are necessary.

623.
**“Were you there?”**
The quoted words (Were you there?) should be surrounded by quotation marks. Because the quotation is a question, the question mark must be attached to the quota- tion. Therefore, it precedes the closing quotation mark.

## Placing Quotation Marks and Other Punctuation
### 625–638 Place commas, periods, question marks, exclamation points, and quotation marks in the sentence as needed. Also capitalize letters as needed. Note: Directly quoted words are underlined. You decide whether the quoted words merit quotation marks.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

626.
**Mark screamed, “Let her go!”**
The first word of a quotation with a speaker tag (in this sentence, Let) should be capi- talized, and the speaker tag (Mark screamed) should be followed by a comma. Because the quoted words are an exclamation, the exclamation point is attached to the quota- tion and should appear inside the quotation marks.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

627.
**Wilbur asked, “Did Christine take a taxi to the theater?”**
In Standard American English usage, the speaker tag (Wilbur asked) should be followed by a comma when it appears before the quotation. The quotation begins with a capital letter and is surrounded by quotation marks. Because the quoted words are a question, the question mark is attached to the quotation and should appear inside the quotation marks.

628.
**Pilar was born in Ecuador, where, she says, “The weather is often hot and humid.”**
The first word of a quotation in a sentence with a speaker tag should be capitalized. In this sentence, the speaker tag is she says. It is not part of the quotation and should not be preceded by a quotation mark. The only words inside the quotation marks are those that Pilar says: the weather is hot and humid. In Standard American English usage, the period precedes the closing quotation mark.

629.
**Xavier eventually declared that his unusual name was “awesome.”**
Only one word is quoted, and you have no speaker tag. (You may have thought that declared qualified as a speaker tag, but because it’s followed by that, it’s not a speaker tag.) No speaker tag means no capital letters for the quoted word (unless, of course, the quoted word is a proper name or the pronoun I). In Standard American English usage, the period precedes the closing quotation mark. Note: If you’re quoting only one or two words, decide whether the words are distinctive, revealing character or mood. If so, place the word(s) in quotation marks. If the words are common and you have no special context, you can skip the quotation marks. Here, awesome tells you something about Xavier’s personality, so quotation marks are appropriate.

630.
**“I wonder where the birthday candles are,” Grandma whispered, “and if we have enough.”**
In this sentence the speaker tag (Grandma whispered) appears in the middle of the sen- tence. The second half of the quotation doesn’t begin with a capital letter (unless, of course, it happens to be a proper name or the pronoun I) because it’s a continuation of the first half of the quotation, not a new sentence. Commas set off the speaker tag. The first comma belongs, according to Standard American English usage, inside the closing quota- tion mark. The second follows the speaker tag. The period at the end of the sentence, also according to Standard American English usage, precedes the closing quotation mark.

632.
**Marisa explained that she was “completely exhausted”; she and Lola went home**
immediately. The quoted words are tucked into the sentence and not introduced by a speaker tag. Therefore, you don’t need a comma or a capital letter to set them off from the rest of the sentence. Semicolons appear after the closing quotation mark.

633.
**No change**
The underlined words (knife, pony) came out of Henry’s mouth (or pen or computer), but here they appear without a speaker tag or context. Also, they do not reveal any- thing about Henry’s character or mood, so no quotation marks are necessary.

634.
**“When he learned to read, Daryl was five,” declared Jordan, “not ten years old.”**
The speaker tag (declared Jordan) is in the middle of this quotation. It should be set off by commas. The first word of the second portion of the quotation should not be capi- talized, unless it’s a proper noun or the pronoun I. According to Standard American English usage, the first comma setting off the speaker tag belongs inside the closing quotation mark, as does the period at the end of the sentence.

635.
**Robbie explained, “The teacher thinks I am ‘supersmart.’”**
A quotation inside another quotation is surrounded by single quotation marks, in Standard American English usage. Because supersmart isn’t preceded by a speaker tag, it isn’t capitalized. The larger quotation (the teacher thinks I am supersmart) begins with a capital letter. The speaker tag (Robbie explained) is followed by a comma. The period at the end of the sentence appears before the closing quotation marks, as Standard American English usage requires.

**“It is going to rain,” Harry predicted. “The picnic will be postponed.”**
Did you have trouble with this one? The fact that words are quoted doesn’t give you license to create a run-on sentence. End the sentence after predicted, which is part of the speaker tag, Harry predicted. Begin the second sentence with a capital letter. As Standard American English usage requires, place the commas at the end of the first quotation and the period at the end of the second sentence before the closing quotation marks.

637.
**Will said that the cheese smelled “funky”: It had been in the refrigerator for more than a**
year. The quoted word, funky, is unusual and tells you something about the speaker who chose it as a description. Therefore, funky should be surrounded by quotation marks. The colon follows the closing quotation mark. Because the sentence has no speaker tag and the quotation is in a clause beginning with that, no capital letters are needed. By the way, when you link two complete sentences with a colon, the second half of the statement begins with a capital letter.

## Punctuating Academic Work
### 639–646 Place commas, periods, question marks, exclamation points, and quotation marks, as needed, in the sentence. Also insert capital letters where needed. Note: To help you identify titles and directly quoted words, these elements are underlined. (Assume that all titles belong to short works that are normally placed in quotation marks.) Citations appear in parentheses, as they do in academic papers.

# Chapter 14
## Not Just for Railroad Tracks: Parallelism
Picture railroad tracks as a train chugs along. What happens if the tracks aren’t perfectly parallel? Derailment and disaster! The damage to your sentence may not be as obvious, but it occurs, nevertheless, if your sentence isn’t parallel. Watch out when you write lists, comparisons, and any sentences with two or more matched elements (sub- jects, verbs, clauses, and so forth); they’re only parallel if everything performing the same function has the same grammatical identity — perhaps all infinitives or all gerunds or all clauses. Don’t worry about the grammar terms. Just listen to the voice inside your head reading your words. If a sentence or list sounds balanced, it’s probably parallel. In this chap- ter you answer questions on all sorts of parallel situations.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these types of questions:
✓	Ensuring that lists are parallel
✓	Keeping elements parallel when they’re joined by paired conjunctions (either/or,
­neither/nor, both/and, not only/but also)
✓	Writing parallel comparisons with rather/than, as much as, more/than, and other
­connectors
✓	Avoiding unnecessary shifts in verb tense, person, and active/passive voice

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	When you’re dealing with a pair of conjunctions, check that the same grammatical
structure follows each half of the conjunction pair. In other words, if a subject-verb pair
follows either, a subject-verb pair must follow or.
✓	Check all comparisons to be sure that the items compared have the same grammatical
structure. You can compare a description to a description or a verb to a verb, but not a
verb to a description.
✓	Avoid switching from active (I wrote a speech) to passive voice (the speech was read by me).
✓	Unless the meaning of the sentence requires a change in tense, be consistent.
✓	Don’t change from one person (say, third person, as in they study) to another (such as
the second-person statement you learn) unless you have a good reason to do so.

## Identifying Parallel Elements in Lists

**I. and II. (I. skiing, skating, complaining; II. to plant, to sow, to reap)**
In Line I, all the words are gerunds — verb forms that function as nouns. In Line II, all are infinitives (to + verb). In Line III (going to sleep, waking up, ready for work), you have two gerunds and then a description, ready for work. You don’t need to know the grammar terms. Just listen to each list. You can hear that I and II match, but III doesn’t. Therefore, I and II are parallel.

**III. (Ringo plays the drums, Paul strums the guitar, I sing along)**
Line I (sung by the Beatles, recording a hit song, performed by the school chorus) has two past participles (sung, performed) and descriptions attached to them. It also has a present-tense -ing form (recording). Because the present and past are mixed together in this list, it isn’t parallel. Line II (heard everywhere, is popular, has many fans) also mixes present (is, has) and past (heard), so it’s not parallel either. Only Line III matches, with three present-tense, subject-verb pairs, so only III is parallel.

**III. (because I said so, when the blizzard rages, after the game ends)**
Line I (early opening, excellent service, committed to quality) has two nouns with attached descriptions (early opening, excellent service) and a description — specifically, a past participle (committed). Line I isn’t parallel. Line II (Lisa’s spying on her neighbors, the detective tapping her phone, the judge hearing the case), at first glance, looks good because three people are paired with activities. However, examine the first of the three pairs. Instead of a noun, Lisa, you have a possessive, Lisa’s. That little difference is important, because the verb form spying then functions as a noun because it’s described by Lisa’s. The other two elements are nouns (detective, judge) described by verb forms (tapping, hearing). Line II isn’t parallel. Line III includes three clauses, all dependent. (In other words, they can’t stand by themselves as complete sentences.) Line III is parallel.

**I. and II. (I. a bulldozer piled up sand, the dump truck carted it away, the jackhammer**
broke the pavement; II. gliding, smoothing the ice, stopping by the fence) In Line I, all the statements are complete sentences. Line I is parallel. Line II is also par- allel because three gerunds (gliding, smoothing, stopping) match. True, two of the three gerunds have descriptions attached. However, the descriptions don’t matter. The important word, the gerund, does matter when you decide whether a list is parallel. Line III isn’t parallel because it contains two nouns with attached descriptions (soil rich in nutrients, endangered species of plants), and a simple prepositional phrase (in the botanical garden).

**II. (buying a cottage, replacing the roof that was damaged in the storm, redecorating)**
Line I (screamed, threw food, epic tantrum) isn’t parallel because two verbs (screamed, threw) don’t match a noun (tantrum). Notice that the descriptions here aren’t an issue; only the core of each item (verbs and a noun) matters. Line II is parallel precisely because the important elements do match; buying, replacing, and redecorating are all gerunds. Ignore the attached descriptions and objects. Line III (hid under a chair, away from other players, whispered) includes two verbs (hid, whispered) but one preposi- tional phrase (away from other players), so it’s not parallel.

**II. (whoever is hungry, whatever you need, whomever I ask)**
Line I (the puppy to watch, to take to the park, the kitten to cuddle) isn’t parallel because the first and third items have a noun (puppy, kitten) described by infinitives (to watch, to cuddle). The middle item has no noun anchoring the descriptions, just an infinitive (to take to the park). True, park is a noun. In this item, though, it’s not being described. Instead, it’s part of a description. Line II is parallel because it contains three dependent clauses (subject-verb statements that don’t make sense by themselves). Line III isn’t parallel because the first item (when winter comes) is a dependent clause, but the second and third items (the snow piles up, the plow scours the streets) are independent clauses, capable of standing alone.

**III. (tomorrow, yesterday, soon)**
Line I (twist and shout, dance the night away, went to the movies) isn’t parallel because the first two items are commands, with you as an understood subject. The last is just a past-tense verb, went, with no subject. Line II (the parrot with yellow feathers, the dog running away, a zoo is out of control) has one independent clause (a zoo is out of con- trol), a subject-verb statement that makes sense by itself. Line II also has two nouns (parrot, dog) with attached descriptions, but no verbs. Therefore, Line II isn’t parallel. Line III contains three adverbs and is parallel.

## Working with Paired Conjunctions
### 662–673 How should the underlined words be changed, if at all, to make the sentence parallel?

  
662.	 I would rather work in the library than to go home.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

662.
**go home (I would rather work in the library than go home.)**
The paired conjunction rather than may appear with both words together or with words in between. When the words are separated, check what follows rather and com- pare that to whatever follows than. The elements should match grammatically. Here, work precedes the conjunction, so go should follow. Because both are verbs, they create a parallel sentence.

663.	 Style depends not only how you look but also on attitude.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

663.
**on looks (Style depends not only on looks but also on attitude.)**
After the second half of this conjunction (but also) you have a prepositional phrase, on attitude. To make the sentence parallel, you need a prepositional phrase after the first half of the conjunction, not only. On looks fits perfectly.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

664.
**too long (Oliver’s supposed masterpiece was both tuneless and too long.)**
After the first half of the conjunction pair (both) you have a simple description — tuneless. So you need a simple description after the second half of the conjunction pair (and). Too long is a simple description — that is, not a phrase or a clause — and makes the sentence parallel. If the first element has no verb form (being or was, for example), the second element shouldn’t have one either.

665.
**you will be either accepted (When you apply for a selective school, you will be either**
accepted or rejected; you won’t know unless you try.) After the second half of the conjunction pair, or, you have a description, rejected. That’s what you need after the first half of the conjunction pair, either. Rearrange the words so that either precedes accepted to make your sentence parallel.

</details>

- 
666.	 Recipes in that cookbook contain meat rather than they have vegetables.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

666.
**vegetables (Recipes in that cookbook contain meat rather than vegetables.)**
The paired conjunction in this sentence is rather than (which may appear together or with words in between). When rather than shows up together, compare what precedes it to what follows it. Here, meat precedes the paired conjunction, so vegetables should follow. Both are nouns and balance nicely.

</details>

667.
**the general agreed (Both the soldiers and the general agreed, so the proposed change to**
the battle plan was accepted.) When you see the paired conjunction both/and, check what follows each half. After both you have a noun, soldiers. Therefore, you need a noun after and: the general. The verb agreed works with two subjects, the soldiers and the general.

668.
**No change**
After the first half of the conjunction pair, both, you have a noun and some descrip- tions attached to the noun (the patient’s blood pressure). After the second half of the conjunction pair, you have the same grammatical element: slower heart rate. Perfectly parallel!

</details>

670.	 Neither Jean’s absence nor that her coworkers were on a coffee break mattered, as no customers called.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

669.
**careful (Mary was not only fair but careful to explain her decision to the contestants.)**
The paired conjunction not only/but also sometimes — but not always — drops the also. After the first half of the conjunction pair (not only), a simple description (fair) appears. Place another simple description (careful) after the second half of the con- junction (but) to create a parallel sentence. You could also use the simple description, also careful, to complete the sentence.

</details>

671.	 Ximena neither explained nor cared if someone mispronounced her name.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

671.
**No change**
After the first half of the paired conjunction, neither, you have a verb (explained). After the second half of the conjunction, nor, you need another verb (cared).

</details>

672.	 The film director will not only emphasize special effects but also she will design them herself.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

672.
**design (The film director will not only emphasize special effects but also design them**
herself.) After the first half of the paired conjunction, not only, you have a verb (emphasize). After the second half of the paired conjunction, but also, you need a verb too: design. With that change, the sentence is parallel.

</details>

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

673.
**plan (Participants in the study either have worked in a laboratory or plan to do so within**
five years.) After the first half of the paired conjunction, either, you have a verb (have worked). After the second half of the conjunction, or, you need another verb (plan). Don’t worry about the change in tense; it’s justified by the meaning of the sentence. Did you opt for are planning? That’s correct also.

674.
**Playing baseball (Playing baseball is as appealing to Suri as baking cookies.)**
The comparison in this sentence is created by as . . . as. The sentence compares to play baseball (an infinitive) with baking cookies (a gerund). Not parallel! Change the infinitive to playing baseball and both halves of the comparison match.

677.
**because of his tracking mud (George’s mother was upset with him more because of his**
lateness than because of his tracking mud on the kitchen floor.) The words more . . . than create the comparison. After more you have a prepositional phrase, because of his lateness. Therefore, you need another prepositional phrase after than. Did you opt for to track mud? That’s not a prepositional phrase; it’s an infinitive phrase, because track is a verb, not a noun acting as the object of a preposition. Because of his mud tracks or a similar phrase would also be correct.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

679.
**your scores (Are your scores on the real SAT as high as your scores on the practice test?)**
Two conjunctions, as and as, create the comparison between scores on two tests. The original sentence tries to balance scores on the real SAT (a noun with descriptions attached) with what you got on the practice test, a clause (a subject-verb statement). Nope! Not parallel. Change the second half of the comparison to your scores, and the sentence becomes parallel. The pronoun those, meaning your scores, would also work here.

</details>

681.
**for John (Spelling is easier for me than for John.)**
The sentence revolves around the word than. Just before than you have a prepositional phrase, for me. To make the sentence parallel, a prepositional phrase, for John, should follow than also.

682.
**to prepare as much today as tomorrow (We have to prepare as much today as tomorrow.)**
What’s being compared in this sentence is what we have to do on two different days. You can balance the comparison in a couple of different ways, but the shortest version moves the beginning of the comparison (much) to the spot preceding what’s being compared (today). The second as then precedes the other element you’re comparing (tomorrow).

## Keeping Sentences Parallel
### 683–696 How should the underlined portion of the sentence be changed, if at all, to make the sentence parallel?

683.	 Pursued by a bear, Nicholas ran as fast as possible to the car, and then he locks the door.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

683.
**he locked (Pursued by a bear, Nicholas ran as fast as possible to the car, and then he**
locked the door.) The beginning of the sentence is in past tense. For no good reason, the original sen- tence changes from past tense (ran) to present (locks). Once you swap he locked for he locks, everything is in past tense and the sentence is parallel.

</details>

684.	 Before you disconnect the water pipe, the valve should be turned off by you.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

684.
**you should turn off the valve (Before you disconnect the water pipe, you should turn off**
the valve.) The first part of the sentence is in active voice: The subject (you) does the action ­(disconnect). The second part of the sentence, in the original version, is passive. The subject (valve) receives the action (should be turned off). Change passive to active (you should turn off the valve) and the sentence is parallel. You can also say turn off the valve to make a parallel sentence.

686.
**he later examined her (Dr. Weber admitted the patient, Ms. Smith, to the hospital, and he**
later examined her.) The first half of the sentence is in active voice; the subject (Dr. Weber) performs the action (admitted). In the original sentence, the second half shifts into passive voice, in which the subject (the patient) receives the action (was examined). Reword the second half to make the verb active, and you’re correct.

**actors must speak forcefully (They should capture the audience’s attention right away,**
so actors must speak forcefully when the curtain rises.) The sentence begins with the plural pronoun they. Why shift to the singular term, an actor? If you begin with a plural, stay with a plural (actors) unless the meaning requires a change.

**cooled by a pond (Shirley smiled when she saw the backyard, which was bordered by**
daisies, shaded by oak trees, and cooled by a pond.) This backyard sounds nice! Every description on the list, except the underlined por- tion, is passive. In passive voice, the subject receives the action. So the yard was bor- dered, was shaded, and was cooled. Conveniently, the first was works for the whole list, so you don’t need to repeat that word. (If you do, you have to use it for all three verbs, not just the first and third.)

**to learn new languages, and to visit foreign countries (To study other cultures, to learn**
new languages, and to visit foreign countries are worthwhile pursuits.) In a list of three infinitives (to + verb), you have two choices. You can let the first to work for all three (to learn, study, and visit), or you can repeat to in front of each item (to study, to learn, and to visit). What you can’t do is place to in front of two terms and not the third — not if you want a parallel sentence.

691.
**is convenient (Bicycle riding helps people become physically fit and is convenient too.)**
The original sentence consists of two complete thoughts linked by and. The first half is in third person, talking about bicycle riding and people. The second half shifts to second person, talking to you. The original isn’t parallel because of the shift in person (from third to second). The easiest fix is to let bicycle riding be the subject of two verbs, helps and is. Now everything is in third person.

Change the original to include neither slang words nor common texting abbreviations. Another possible correction is include no slang words or common texting abbreviations.

**An apple, a pear, and a banana (An apple, a pear, and a banana are in the fruit bowl.)**
A and an are articles. The first precedes words beginning with consonants, and the second precedes words beginning with vowel sounds. In the original sentence, an is the only article in front of three nouns (apple, pear, banana). Two of those nouns begin with consonants, so an is out of place. Add the missing articles, and your sentence is parallel.

storm damage, this plan is excellent.) The first part of the sentence focuses on a noun (solution), but then the sentence shifts to a prepositional phrase (in prevention of). Stay with two nouns (solution . . . and pre- vention) and you’re fine. Another correct sentence employs two phrases (With a short- term solution for hurricane victims and in prevention of future storm damage).

# Chapter 15
## Slimming Down: Cutting Repetition and Wordiness
Do your sentences need to go on a diet? Are they chubby around the middle, with repetitive or wordy elements? If so, consider this chapter your path to trimmer, more powerful expression.

## The Questions You’ll Work On

In this chapter, you work on these concepts:
✓	Identifying synonyms or other repetitious expressions
✓	Writing concisely by eliminating unnecessary words

## What to Watch Out For. 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:

✓	Many words are close in meaning. Tense, for example, refers to how you feel when your
muscles clench as tightly as possible. Nervous, on the other hand, describes the jitters
that zing through your nervous system. Chances are you don’t need both tense and
nervous to describe one mood. Look for the right word, the one that truly fits the
situation in your sentence.
✓	Shorter isn’t always better, but nobody likes to waste time. Look for extra words:
doubled descriptions, unnecessary explanations, and overly complicated sentence
structure. When you find these issues, revise the sentence.


## Cutting Repetitive Words and Phrases from Sentences
### 697–706 What words, if any, are repetitive in the sentence? Note: For the purpose of this exercise, assume that words close in meaning, but not identical, are unnecessary.

697.	 Mike, who is a fitness fanatic, jogged on streets and roads each and every morning.

**streets, roads; each, every**

Easiest, most carefree, and with no effort all express the same idea. One is enough! Did you trip over ovens and other kitchen equipment? Ovens are kitchen equipment, so that phrase without the word other would be repetitious. Including other, however, brings in the rest of the machinery in your kitchen — blenders, dishwashers, and so forth. Because other adds information, the phrase is not repetitious.

**popular, hit; small, that has 500 inhabitants**
When something is popular, it’s a hit. The next pair is trickier. Small is a relative term. In Manhattan, a small building may have ten floors when it’s compared to a skyscraper. In another context, a ten-floor structure may be the largest building in the area. In this sen- tence, though, cross out small and let the more specific term (that has 500 inhabitants) remain. The reader gets the information and can decide whether such a town is small.

## Writing Concisely
### 707–721 How should the original sentence best be revised, if at all, to avoid wordiness? **Note**: Be sure the revision you choose is grammatically correct and faithful to the meaning of the original sentence.

707.	 Original sentence: The title character in Macbeth is ambitious, and it is this ambition that leads him to crime.


I.

**IV. (The ambition of the title character of Macbeth leads him to crime.)**
The original sentence (The title character in Macbeth is ambitious, and it is this ambition that leads him to crime) repeats ambitious and ambition. Revision IV includes all the information of the original, which has 17 words, in 12 words. You may notice that Revisions I, II, and III are shorter than IV. However, something is lacking in each. In Revision I (The title character, Macbeth, has ambition and leads him to crime), the sub- ject of leads is title character — not the meaning you want. Revision II (Leading to crime, the title character in Macbeth is ambitious) has the same meaning because the introduc- tory verb form, leading, describes the subject of the sentence (title character). Revision III (Ambition leads to crime in Shakespeare’s Macbeth) drops an important reference to the title character. Only IV does the job.

**I. (Fair and reasonable, Jill saw the advantages and disadvantages of both sides in every**
argument.) Revision I cuts four words from the original (Jill was always fair and reasonable, and she saw the advantages and disadvantages of both sides in every argument) without sac- rificing meaning. If it’s every argument, always is implied. By turning was always fair and reasonable into an introductory description, you also save words. Revision II (Jill was always fair and reasonable, and she saw each side’s advantages and disadvantages) is longer than Revision I and omits the idea of argument. Without that word, the sen- tence may discuss political or social advantages of siding with one or another group. Revision III (Jill seeing the advantages and disadvantages of both sides in every argument fairly) is a fragment, not a complete sentence. Revision IV (Jill’s fairness and reason- ableness led her to see both sides) may refer to a visit with two sides, not an evaluation of each argument.

Eight words shorter than the original (It was this place, Illinois, that saw the birth of Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest presidents who ever headed the United States), Revision II has all the information you need. The construction it was this . . . that is almost always unnecessary. Avoid it in your writing!

**I. (Fifi loves going to the park, where she plays with other dogs.)**
Revision I of the original sentence (Fifi, who is a dog, loves going to the park; the park is where she plays with other dogs) is short and complete. Once you see other dogs, you don’t have to label Fifi as a dog. Her identity is clear. Nor should you repeat the park. Revision II (Fifi, who is a dog, loves going to the park and plays with other dogs) isn’t parallel because going and plays don’t match. Revision III (Fifi, who is a dog, loves going to the park with other dogs) changes the meaning slightly, implying that Fifi travels to the park with other dogs. Maybe Fifi does, but the original sentence simply states that she plays with other dogs there. Revision IV (Fifi, a dog who loves going to the park, plays with other dogs there) drops the repetitive reference to park but unnecessarily labels Fifi as a dog.

**No change**
The original sentence (When I asked Dr. Spencer about his training, he told me that he had studied at Oxford University in Britain) doesn’t need any revision. Revision IV (Dr. Spencer trained at Oxford) is tempting, isn’t it? Only five words! The problem with IV, and with the other revisions (I: Dr. Spencer told me that he had studied at Oxford University in Britain; II: Dr. Spencer studied at Oxford University in Britain; and III: Dr. Spencer told me that his studies took place at Oxford University in Britain), is that some information is missing, and all of it may be relevant. For example, imagine that you visit Dr. Spencer and he blurts out, unasked, that he studied at Oxford. Is he defen- sive about his preparation for the job? Does he like to brag? Either situation is possi- ble. If you ask, however, then his answer is simple courtesy. Similarly, you can’t cut the identification of Oxford unless you’re certain that the reader knows what you mean. Other institutions have the same name.

If you’re handcuffed, your wrists are restrained. You don’t need to say this twice, as the original sentence does (Handcuffed with their wrists restrained, the burglars then pro- ceeded to demand phone calls, lawyers, and immediate release). Then proceeded is also repetitious. All you need to write is the burglars then demanded. Revision IV is shorter, simpler, and better.

The original sentence reads: We were already sitting in seats when the orchestra, all musicians, began to play at the direction of the conductor, who raised his baton to start the performance. Sitting in seats? Seriously, where else can you sit? Okay, you can sit on the grass or on an exercise ball, but those are the exceptions. Don’t bother placing the common meaning, in seats, in the sentence. Also, the orchestra is made up of all musi- cians — another common fact you don’t have to mention. Finally, began to play and start the performance provide the same information.

This one is tricky. In the original sentence (For four hours, quasars — high energy objects — were observed in that galaxy), the material between the dashes is a definition of quasars. If your readers definitely know what quasars are, you don’t need the defini- tion. However, inserting a definition when you’re explaining something is perfectly legitimate. The original sentence is fine.

Consider the original sentence: In this novel, the author discusses various themes and ideas, all very important concepts that the reader should ponder. When you read a novel and discover ideas to ponder, you know that the author placed them there. (They didn’t show up by accident!) Themes aren’t exactly the same thing as ideas, but the two concepts are close, so select only one. (The simpler expression is ideas, but themes would be fine also.) Furthermore, once you have a plural (themes or ideas), various is implied. Very is sometimes a good word to intensify the meaning of the word it describes, but here important, all by itself, gets the point across. Cut out all those extras and you end up with Revision IV, half as long and twice as powerful as the original.

# Chapter 16
You can — and should — develop a sense of style when you’re writing. Style comes from many factors. In this chapter you work on combining ideas in interesting, fluid ways and experimenting with sentence patterns.bining ideas in interesting, fluid ways
and experimenting with sentence patterns.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions targeting the following:
✓	Inserting information into basic sentences with clauses and phrases
✓	Ensuring that sentences express the intended meaning
✓	Punctuating complicated sentences correctly
✓	Varying the normal subject-verb-complement pattern of a sentence
✓	Experimenting with sentence structure

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Clauses (subject-verb statements) beginning with who, whom, whose, which, or that
usually insert descriptions of nouns or pronouns. Other types of clauses describe
verbs, giving information about time, place, method, or reasons.
✓	Some clauses play crucial roles inside other clauses, acting as subjects or objects.
These clauses often begin with whoever, whomever, or that.
✓	Placed properly, verbals — words that resemble verbs but function as nouns, adjec-
tives, or adverbs — make your writing flow more smoothly. Consider using infinitives
(to + a verb), gerunds (the -ing form of a verb acting as a noun), and participles (a verb
form that may function as an adjective) to spice up your sentences.
✓	When you work with participles and infinitives, check the tense. The present
form places the action or the state of being at the same time as the verb in
the sentence. The past tense places the action or state of being prior to what
the main verb of the sentence expresses.
✓	When you add clauses or phrases, take care that your sentence is complete
(no fragments!) and properly punctuated (no run-ons!).
✓	Essential, identifying information isn’t set off from the rest of the sentence
by commas. Extra information is surrounded by commas.
✓	When a sentence begins with a verbal, the subject of the sentence must
be the one performing the action or in the state of being expressed by the
verbal.
✓	Mature writers vary sentence length and pattern.

**I. and III. (I. The brightly shining lamp is on the table next to the sofa. III. On the table**
next to the sofa is the lamp, which shines brightly.) In Sentences I and III, the lamp, the table, and the sofa are in the correct positions — lamp on table, table next to the sofa. Sentence II (Next to the sofa, the lamp is shining brightly on the table) places next to the sofa far from table; in general, descriptions should be close to whatever they describe. Also, Sentence II implies that the lamp shines on the table. Probably the lamp does light up the table, but it most likely illumi- nates the room as well. Sentences I and III work, but II doesn’t.

Sentence III (Demanding bright colors for fruit and vegetables for consumers, some growers add the color artificially) mistakenly says that the growers are demanding, not the consumers.

**II. and III. (II. Energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs decrease customers’ electric bills.**
III. Fluorescent bulbs, being energy efficient, decrease customers’ electric bills.) Sentence I (Fluorescent bulbs are energy efficient, so they use less energy, and customers’ electric bills are lower) strings together three statements with so and and. Sentence I isn’t terrible, but it’s a little awkward. Sentences II and III, on the other hand, tuck in the idea of using less energy with an adjective (energy-efficient) in Sentence II and a verbal (being energy efficient) in Sentence III. Both II and III flow nicely and communi- cate all the information.

So many words express the ideas in this question! Yet all those ideas boil down to something simple, Studying anatomy may help artists draw human figures. In other words, Sentence I. Sentence II (To study anatomy, which some artists do, is that which helps artists when they draw human figures) adds unnecessary words, as does Sentence III (Studying anatomy, some artists when they are drawing human figures work better).

**All of the sentences**
Four short sentences in this question express the ideas, but Sentences I, II, and III do so more efficiently and smoothly. Sentence I (Because mosquitoes don’t fly well, espe- cially into the wind, a fan can repel mosquitoes) starts with an adverb clause and Sentence II (A fan can repel mosquitoes because they fly poorly into the wind) ends with one (because . . . into the wind). Sentence III (Generating wind, a fan may repel mosquitoes, which don’t fly well) begins with the fan’s role (Generating wind) and adds a descriptive clause at the end of the sentence (which don’t fly well) to ­clarify how the fan affects the bugs. These three sentences are all different, but all are good.

**I. (Programmed properly, computers can mimic musical instruments.)**
Sentence I is short, but it gets the job done. The introductory verbal (programmed properly), and the subject it’s attached to (computers) cover the first two ideas, and the rest is a simple statement (computers can mimic musical instruments). Sentence II (Programming different sounds on a computer results in musical instrument sounds) contains repetition, and Sentence III (To create sounds resembling musical instruments, computer programmers can do that) has a vague pronoun (that) and an awkward structure.

**I. and III. (I. Before the mirror cracked, it was Emily’s favorite possession. III. Until it**
cracked, Emily’s favorite possession was the mirror.) Both Sentence I and Sentence III start off with adverb clauses and move fluidly to Emily’s preference for the mirror. Sentence II (A favorite possession, Emily’s mirror was cracking and then wasn’t favored) begins well but then awkwardly shifts from was crack- ing (an active-voice verb) to wasn’t favored (a passive-voice verb). Shifting from active to passive isn’t a good idea, unless you have no alternative — and you do!

**I. (That Henry cheats is a disgrace.)**
Sentence I begins with an unusual subject, the clause That Henry cheats. This noun clause works perfectly with the rest of the sentence, which tells you that Henry’s cheating is a disgrace. Sentence II (Henry, cheating, is a disgrace) expresses a ­different meaning, making Henry the disgrace, rather than the fact that he cheats. Sentence III (To cheat is a disgrace for Henry) is more accurate, but it’s awkwardly worded.

**I. (After mishearing and misunderstanding a word, people eventually accept the “wrong”**
meaning as right.) Sentence I has it all, conveying the ideas with an introductory phrase (After mishearing and misunderstanding a word) and a concise statement about the evolution of language (people eventually accept the “wrong” meaning as right). The quotation marks around wrong, by the way, signal that the wrong meaning isn’t really wrong. The quotation marks are the equivalent of the expression so-called, as in my so-called friend who stabbed me in the back. Sentence II (To mishear and to misunderstand a word, the mean- ing is accepted as right, even though it used to be wrong) has a dangling description. No one is present in the sentence to mishear and to misunderstand. (When a sentence begins with an introductory verb form, the subject must be the person performing the action.) Sentence III (Because people mishear and misunderstand a word, they accept mistakes and go from wrong to right) is too vague.

**I. (Jim washed his shirt, but the stains made with permanent ink remained.)**
The description made with permanent ink is essential to the reader’s understanding of the sentence. Therefore, it shouldn’t be set off from the rest of the sentence by commas. Sentence I gets this point right, but Sentence II (Jim couldn’t remove the stains, made with permanent ink, from his shirt) doesn’t. Sentence III (Made with perma- nent ink, Jim couldn’t remove the stains from his shirt) begins with a verb form, which, by grammar law, attaches to the subject (Jim). Jim isn’t made with permanent ink, so Sentence III is wrong.

Sentence III starts off with an appositive (an equivalent) — a polished piece of writing. The rest of the sentence states simply and clearly that the essay will win a prize. Sentence III works well.

**III. (Having stayed up all night, Ben fought to keep his eyes open at work the next day.)**
A descriptive verb form usually expresses action that happens at the same time as the action expressed by the main verb in the sentence. However, once you add having, you place the action from the descriptive form before the main action. Ben’s all-nighter took place first, so having stayed up all night is the form you want. Only Sentence III has that form, so only Sentence III is correct.

Having worn and had worn don’t work in this situation.

The descriptive clause that has an index identifies which book I want. Because it’s essential, it shouldn’t be set off by commas. Sentence I (I want the book, that has an index) is wrong, therefore, and Sentence II is right. Sentence III (Having an index, I want that book) has an introductory verb form, which, by the rules of grammar, must describe the subject. The speaker, I, doesn’t have an index. The book does! Sentence III is wrong.

The key to this question is figuring out where everything is and then ensuring that the descriptions put everything in the proper place. You have a surface that’s perfect for hockey and pipes under the surface. Freon flows through the pipes. Okay, now that you know what’s where, check out Sentence I (Creating perfect ice for hockey, through the pipes flowed Freon under the surface). The prepositional phrase under the surface is in the wrong spot; it should follow pipes, because the pipes are under the surface. In Sentence III (Through the pipes Freon under the surface flowed, creating perfect ice for hockey), Freon again separates pipes and under the surface. Penalty box! Only in Sentence II is everything where it should be.

# Chapter 17
## Spotlighting Verbs: Voice and Mood
How’s your voice? I’m not asking whether you sing in the shower. Instead, I’m inquiring about your knowledge of active and passive verbs (qualities known as voice in the grammar world). In this chapter you also get in touch with mood — specifically, when and how to use a verb in subjunctive mood. Sounds complicated, right? It isn’t. Those important-sounding grammar terms mask some very simple principles: active verb forms are nearly always better than passive, and if/then statements require special attention. In this chapter you find practice questions on the voice and mood of verbs.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these types of questions:
✓	Distinguishing between active and passive verb forms
✓	Changing passive verbs to active where appropriate
✓	Selecting the proper verb forms for if/then statements

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	When a sentence has a verb in active voice, the subject performs the action or is in the
state of being expressed by the verb, as in Pete applied for a position with the Peace Corps.
✓	With a passive-voice verb, the subject receives the action, as in The job notice was
posted on the bulletin board.
✓	In general, use passive voice only when an active-voice sentence is awkward or
impossible (when you don’t know who performed the action, for example).
✓	If you discuss a situation that isn’t true, use subjunctive mood for the if statement and
the conditional helping verb would for the other portion of the sentence. Were creates
a subjunctive statement for being verbs; had does the same thing for action verbs.
✓	If you’re talking about a real possibility, don’t use subjunctive in an if/then statement.
✓	The if statement never includes the helping verb would.
✓	Sometimes in an if/then statement, the if is implied. You still need a subjunctive verb in
the clause that sets up the hypothetical situation. Here’s an example, with the subjunctive
verb underlined: Had Natalia understood Italian, she would have scolded the waiter. The
hypothetical statement may also begin with as if or as though.


## Identifying Active an Passive Verb Forms
### 767–774 Identify active verb forms (AV) and passive verb forms (PV). Note: In addition to words functioning as verbs, label descriptive verb forms (participles) as active (AV) or passive (PV).

**were connected (PV), was constructed (PV) (France and England were first connected by**
high-speed trains when the Chunnel, a tunnel under the English Channel, was constructed.) The subject of the first part of this sentence, France and England, receives the action, so were connected is passive. In the second half of the sentence, the subject (tunnel) receives the action, making was constructed a passive verb. Did you select first? That’s an adverb, telling when the action happened.

**blanketed (AV), found (AV) (Fog blanketed the area, but somehow Raymond found the**
path home.) The subject, fog, performs the action in the first portion of this sentence, so blanketed is an active verb. In the second portion of the sentence, the subject (Raymond) per- forms the action. Thus found is also an active verb.

**is working (AV), writes (AV), are (AV) (Carlos’s poetry class is working hard; the poems he**
writes are imaginative.) This is a short sentence packed with verbs. First you have is working — which explains what the subject, class, is doing. Because the subject performs the action, is working is an active verb form. Next up is he writes. The subject, he, does the action (writes), so writes is an active verb. The last subject-verb pair is poems are. The verb here is also active, because the subject (poems) is in the state of being expressed by the verb. Did you struggle with imaginative? It’s an adjective, not a verb.

**rejected (AV), representing (AV), says (AV), was trained (PV) (William rejected 30 appli-**
cants representing 16 schools because, he says, not one was properly trained.) The first subject-verb pair is William rejected. William performs the action, so rejected is an active verb. The next verb form, representing, is a descriptive verb form (a parti- ciple). Although it doesn’t function as a verb, it’s active because what it describes (applicants) performs the action. Next up is says, an active verb because the subject, he, performs the action. The last verb is was trained. It’s passive because its subject, one, receives the action (was trained).

**Having been summoned (PV), was (AV) (Having been summoned to jury duty, Richard was**

## Changing Passive Voice to Active
### 775–781 How should the sentence be changed, if at all, so that the verb is in active voice? Note: A verb may be active and need no change, or a change to active voice may not be possible.

775.
**The clerk stamped the letter after Louella had paid the postage.**
The passive verb was stamped changes to the active stamped once you make clerk the subject of the first part of the sentence. The second subject-verb pair (Louella had paid) is already active, as the subject performs the action.

778.
**Isaac hopes that Governor Mary Smith will lower taxes when she takes over.**
The original sentence has one passive verb, will be lowered. Change that to Governor Mary Smith will lower, and the verb is active. Did you select a descriptive verb form, taking office, to change the sentence? That verb form would work only if the subject were Governor Mary Smith, not Isaac or taxes.

779.
**Riders should wear helmets at all times during bicycle rides.**
The original sentence has a passive verb, should be worn, but you can’t change the verb to active unless you supply someone to wear the helmets. The logical choice is riders, though cyclists or another noun could also work. If you tried to fix the sentence with a descriptive, introductory verb form (riding, for example), you need a subject who’s doing the riding (bicycle riders, perhaps). Remember, a descriptive, introductory verb form describes the subject, and helmets can’t ride! The problem with adding bicy- cle riders or riders is that you end up with an awkward, repetitive sentence, such as this one: Riding a bicycle, riders should wear helmets at all times. Your best choice is to avoid the descriptive verb form.

**If I were a lottery winner (If I were a lottery winner, I would circle the globe on a first-**

**If Marty had been promoted (If Marty had been promoted, he would have taken us to a**

**is suspended (If Alex is suspended, he will miss at least 50 games; the commissioner will**

786.
**No change**
The if statement is at the end of the sentence here, but the same rules apply: Anna did not know how hungry her guests were, so the if statement has a subjunctive verb (had known). The other statement requires the helping verbs would and have to place the action in the past, matching had known and were, verbs that also refer to the past.

**Were Dmitri an accomplished magician (Were Dmitri an accomplished magician, he would**
pull a rabbit out of a hat. Because he’s still learning, he can retrieve only a scarf from a baseball cap.) Dmitri isn’t an accomplished magician, so that part of the sentence needs a subjunc- tive verb, were. If Dmitri were an accomplished is another possible correction.

**was (On the way to the used car lot, Lola made up her mind: If the convertible was in good**
shape, she would buy it.) You don’t need subjunctive because the sentence presents a real possibility — a car that may be in good shape or not. The whole sentence is set in the past (made is a past- tense verb), so a simple past-tense verb, was, works here.

**Had the chef added seasoning (Had the chef added seasoning to that food, it would have**

**would’ve hit (If the pitcher had thrown a fast ball, the batter would’ve hit a home run.)**
The sentence presents a classic subjunctive situation. The if statement tells what didn’t happen, and the other part of the sentence employs the helping verb would. The problem with the original is of. The contraction would have shortens to would’ve, which sounds like would of. The expressions would of, should of, and could of are never correct. Go for would’ve or would have.

**as if Jordan were (The mathematician spoke as if Jordan were his equal, but Jordan has**
trouble adding two and two.) Jordan isn’t the equal of the mathematician, so the subjunctive verb were is necessary here. You may wonder about as if. That expression may introduce a subjunctive situa- tion, just as if alone does. In this sentence as if fits the meaning of the sentence, so don’t change it. The word like, by the way, never begins a subject-verb statement.

# Chapter 18
## Dealing with Electronic Media
One of the best educated people I know recently said, “Grammar in e-mail? You’re kid- ding! I’ve never put a comma in an e-mail. I don’t use them in presentations either.” Well, I do. I put commas in text messages too, as well as in instant messages. I don’t tweet, but if I did, I’d probably throw in a couple of commas there also. Granted, I’m stricter than normal people (in other words, nongrammarians). Plus, I have to admit that communica- tion media change so rapidly that the rules for writing with them have to be fluid also. Most people feel free to drop at least some conventions of grammar when they pull out a smartphone or a tablet or project a presentation slide. But before you toss all the rules, you should know today’s commonly accepted standards for writing e-mails, texts, and instant messages. Furthermore, you should know how to write a list with bullet points — the sort you see on PowerPoint, Prezi, or Keynote presentation slides — without inflicting a fatal wound on Standard English. For help with these skills, read on.

## The Questions You’ll Work On

In this chapter, you work on questions testing these skills:
✓	Capitalizing titles and bullet points in presentation slides and subject lines
✓	Punctuating bulleted lists, e-mails, texts, and instant messages
✓	Creating parallel bulleted lists
✓	Communicating clearly and achieving the right degree of formality in electronic media

## What to Watch out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	The title of a presentation slide, if it has one, follows the headline style of capitaliza-
tion. Subject lines of e-mails usually do so also, though you have more leeway there.
✓	All the items on a bullet-point list should be parallel. In other words, they should have
the same grammatical identity.
114
✓	If the bulleted list begins with an introductory sentence, use a colon if the sentence is
complete or if the bullet points aren’t part of the introductory statement. Don’t place
any punctuation after an introductory statement that ends with a linking verb (any
form of to be) or if the bullet points combine with the introductory statement to form a
complete sentence.
✓	Commonly used (and mutually understood) abbreviations are fine in instant messages
and texts. Breaking some rules of capitalization and punctuation is generally accepted
in these short forms, as long as the meaning is clear. Words may also be omitted or
implied, unless they are necessary for clarity.
✓	When writing to someone who outranks you (a supervisor, a teacher, an elderly rela-
tive), follow the rules of Standard English.

## Presentation Slides
### 797–814 What changes, if any, should you make to the underlined material to create a grammatically correct presentation slide?

**Capitalize American, no change, capitalize First**
American is part of the title, so it should be capitalized. (It also comes from the name of a country — another reason for a capital letter.) Inventors is fine as written, but First should be capitalized. In a bulleted list not composed of complete sentences, you may choose to capitalize or lowercase the first word of every item, but you must be consis- tent. (Of course, if a bullet begins with a proper name, you should capitalize the name even if other bullets begin with lowercase letters.) In this slide, the first two bullets are capitalized, so the third one must be also.

**No change, delete period after expense, change to better attendance**
The introduction to this list is a complete sentence, so a colon (:) is perfect after fol- lowing. Drop the period after expense because items in a list generally don’t end with periods unless the items are complete sentences. More employees can attend must change because the other items in the list aren’t complete sentences, so this one doesn’t match. A good choice is better attendance, but any noun and attached descrip- tion (increased attendance), for example, would work.

Two of the three items in the list are nouns, but the first item adds a verb (served). Because all the items should match, delete served as.

**Capitalize What, change the period to a colon after dance, lowercase music**
The first word of an introductory phrase (in this slide, What) should be capitalized. As an introduction to the list, What we need for the annual dance should be followed by a colon, not a period, because the bullet points don’t complete the sentence started by the introduction. The items in the list aren’t complete sentences, and the first two items in the list are in lowercase, so music shouldn’t be capitalized.

**No change, no change, change to fake engagement announcement for Pam and Steve (2010)**
When an introductory line ends with a linking verb (a form of the verb to be), don’t place any punctuation after the verb. Items in a bulleted list, unless they are complete sentences, generally aren’t capitalized, so glue is fine. The second bullet point is a com- plete sentence, but the first and third points aren’t. All bullet points should match, so change the complete sentence to a noun and its attached descriptions — fake engage- ment announcement for Pam and Steve (2010).

No punctuation fol- lows because of, given that the sentence isn’t complete. The bullet points complete the sentence, so they must begin with lowercase letters. Each point must make sense when it is inserted into the introductory statement. All the bullet points meet this standard. Here’s one example: Stradivarius violins are expensive because of their limited numbers.

The two little words here don’t make sense as an introductory statement, but they work as a title. Capitalize both words (Revenue Sources). The first three bullet points match; they’re all nouns with attached descriptions. The fourth bullet point is a sen- tence and therefore a mismatch. (In grammar terms, it’s not parallel.) If you delete the last bullet point, all the remaining bullet points are nouns. What about the 20% increase? If you truly needed that information in the slide, you could place it in paren- theses after the noun, making the last bullet point more specific by specifying the reve- nue source (alumni gifts, for example) and adding 20% increase in parentheses after the source of additional funds.

The key rule of writing — in any medium — is clarity. Only Option II (walk?) is clearly a request. Options I (walk today) and III (Want to walk) may be read as commands or statements about the message writer — not the intended meaning. Did the lowercase w and the absence of a subject bother you? Because this is a message between friends, the rules of capitalization and complete sentences can be ignored.

Okay, most teachers would prefer a text saying Please let me know how Susie’s grades turned out this semester. Most teachers would also like to win the lottery. Because texts are hard on your thumbs and everyone is busy, broken grammar rules are fine as long as the person receiving the text understands what the sender is saying. Option I (grades good) may be a statement of the parent’s opinion. Option II (Grades?) may be an inquiry about a missing report card. Only Option III (grades good?) lets the teacher know what the parent wants — the teacher’s opinion on the child’s performance.

**II.**
In Option I, the subject line is blank. The subject line of an e-mail should communicate the topic of the message; otherwise, the person who receives the message will proba- bly delete it unread. Option III has no spacing between Dear Customer and the message or between Sincerely and the message. Nor is there a space between Sincerely and the sender’s identification. Option II properly spaces the parts of the message and includes a subject line.

If you want a book contract, you have to show that you can write. Option I (This recipe for tomato stew needs a hint of dates) is formal and correct. Option III (Add a hint of dates to this tomato stew and wow!) is informal but also acceptable. Option II (This recipe 4 tomato stew needs a hint of d8s) substitutes numbers for sounds (4 instead of for, d8s instead of dates). Nope. In a blog, let real words rule.

**II. and III.**
Option I (no writing paper by herself) is unclear. The history teacher may be saying that he’s seen no writing by herself (by the student in question) or answering no, [she’s] writing the paper by herself. The extra space between no and the rest of the message isn’t enough to clarify the meaning. Option II (no, writing paper by herself) includes a comma, and Option III (No. Writing paper by herself) a period. These punctuation marks separate the no and clarify the important point — that the student is doing her own work. True, Options II and III don’t follow all the grammar rules, but the teacher and counselor are equals. Bending the rules a bit when you’re writing to someone of the same rank is acceptable in instant messages, as long as the meaning is clear.

You can argue on this one, because out there somewhere is a grandfather who under- stands texting abbreviations such as (G2G – got to go and ttyl – talk to you later). However, those grandfathers are pretty rare. When you text to someone who outranks you in age or status (and a grandfather fits both categories), use Standard English, as Option III (I have to go, Gramps. I’ll talk to you later) does.

Option I assumes that the person who receives the message will realize that the sub- ject line is the entire message. Option III is annoying. Capital letters are useful, but an entire message in capital letters comes across as a shout — a bad-mannered, hard-to- read shout. Stick with Option II, which could perhaps be more diplomatic but is funda- mentally correct.

**III.**
If you want readers to take you seriously, you have to take yourself seriously — and follow at least some of the rules for Standard English. In Standard English, gr8 isn’t a proper substitute for great, so Option I (gr8 CGI in the crashing planet sequence) is out. Option II (great CGI in the crashing planet sequence) is better, but because the website is for general readers, not film buffs, the abbreviation for computer generated imagery (CGI) may be confusing. Option III (great special effects in the crashing planet sequence) substitutes special effects — much more comprehensible and therefore the best choice.

Yes, you can — with your bff (best friend forever) — use shorthand when you text or send an instant message. You can also break the rules of capitalization, spelling (your instead of you’re), and punctuation. As always, the only nonnegotiable quality is clar- ity. Option I (omg I cant believe it) employs a common abbreviation (omg = oh my God or oh my goodness). Lol, from Option III (lol your joking), is also a commonly accepted way to say laughing out loud. You may have been tricked by Option II (idnbi), which uses a made-up abbreviation (idnbi means I do not believe it).

# Chapter 19
## Choosing Language to Suit Your Audienc
When people find out that I write grammar books, some go into “gotcha” mode. They scrutinize everything I say, hoping to catch a mistake. And they do! In fact, they should. Why? Because formal, totally proper English isn’t appropriate for all situations. When you’re at a party, you probably employ what I call “conversational English” — a less formal version of the language that features shortened or dropped words, incomplete sentences, and similar elements. Conversational English makes you more approachable. One level down is even less formal, what I call “friendspeak.” On this level you make some mistakes on purpose, using slang and throwing in me instead of I or who instead of whom. Of course, in school or on the job, proper English is generally the goal. In this chapter you practice moving from level to level of correctness, depending upon the situation you’re in. These questions check your ability to adapt your oral or ­written expression as needed.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that test these skills:
✓	Identifying levels of formality
✓	Suiting your words to a particular situation

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	If you’re speaking or writing to someone with more power than you, formal English is
best. However, no one likes to hear stiff, old-fashioned, or flowery expressions. Even in
formal English, strive for direct and clear expression.
✓	When communicating with peers, let the relationship and situation guide you. A friend
in the office may be comfortable with conversational English while you’re gossiping at
the coffee machine but not when you’re writing a business memo. On Friday night away
from the office, friends may “kick off their grammar shoes” and break every rule in the
book.
122
✓	Slang works only when everyone who’s supposed to be part of the conver-
sation understands what you’re saying. By its nature, slang excludes some
people, usually on purpose. Teenagers invent terms all the time specifically to
mystify adults — and succeed beautifully!
✓	Jargon — specialized terms, abbreviations, and acronyms — is fine only if the
intended audience comprehends. Acronyms are formed from the first letter of
each word in a name (NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for example).
✓	Electronic communication (text or instant messages, blogs, e-mails) sometimes
relax the usual grammar rules, but even there, take care if you’re writing to
someone of higher status in a given situation.

## Identifying Levels of Formality
### 827–836 Place these expressions in order of formality, moving from the most formal to the least. **Note**: Two expressions may “tie.” For example, your answer may be **1 and 2, 3**. In that answer, the first and second statements have the same level of formality, and the third statement is less formal than the first two.

827.	 

1.
You just don’t get it.
2.
You do not comprehend the situation.
3.
You don’t understand what happened.

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

827.
**2, 3, 1 (2. You do not comprehend the situation. 3. You don’t understand what happened.**
1. You just don’t get it.) Expression 2 is the most formal, with no contractions (such as don’t, which you see in Expression 3) and the somewhat sophisticated word comprehend. Expression 3 is cor- rect but a little more relaxed, with the contraction don’t and what happened instead of the situation. Expression 1 includes slang: to get it means to understand. Slang is always very informal.

**1, 2, 3 (1. I provide herein; 2. I enclose; 3. Here’s)**
Expression 1 uses an old-fashioned, totally formal word, herein. Expression 2 is more modern and less formal. Expression 3 is a contraction (here’s is short for here is). The contraction makes this expression the least formal of the three.

829.
**1, 3, 2 (1. Don’t worry about that issue. 3. Forget it, please. 2. Hey, don’t flip out!)**
All three of these statements attempt to reassure the listener or reader. Expression 1 is the most formal, with a complete sentence including a dignified phrase, that issue. Expression 2 employs slang (flip out = get upset), as well as the informal greeting, hey. Somewhere in the middle is Expression 3, which attaches please to a complete sentence.

831.
**3, 2, 1 (3. I will meet you later today. 2. See you later. 1. C U L8R)**
Expression 1 uses texting abbreviations (C = see, U = you, L8R = later) and is the least formal writing possible. Expression 2 is closer to proper English, but the subject and part of the verb (I will) are implied rather than stated. Expression 3 is correct and com- plete — the most formal of the three.

832.
**3, 1 and 2 (3. I apologize. 1. My bad. 2. Oops! Sorry.)**
I apologize is grammatically correct and proper for all occasions. Expressions 1 and 2 are less formal because they include slang (my bad = my mistake, understood as an apology, and oops, an expression admitting an accident or error).

**1, 3, 2 (1. Does this interest you? 3. Are you in? 2. r u in?)**
Expression 1 has no contractions or slang, so it’s formal. Expression 3, on the other hand, uses a shortened form of the expression — close to slang. Are you in? means Are you interested? and is conversational. The least formal is Expression 2, which uses texting abbreviations, r (are) and u (you).

Pursuant to your request begins with an unusual word. (Pursuant comes from the same root as pursue, which means follow.) Because Expression 3 is probably familiar only to the read-the-dictionary-for-fun types, it’s the most formal.

**I. (Would you please write a letter of recommendation?)**
A teacher has more power than a student, and so does anyone who’s doing you a favor. Statement II (You get me. Wanna write for me? — which a student actually sent!) is too informal. Statement III (r u ok to write 4 me?) is never acceptable in an e-mail, text, or instant message to anyone other than a close friend.

so I want a refund.) Statement I is rude, but it does get the point across. (Courtesy, of course, is always best, but grammatically this one works.) Statement II conveys the message more politely. It too is fine. Statement III (Vacuum = busted. Refund = mine) probably won’t be taken seriously by a manufacturer. (Would you send money to someone who uses this sort of language?)

**All of the statements**
Because Lily and Anthony are close friends, they probably text each other often and understand these abbreviations. Grammarians usually hate such shortcuts, but realists know abbreviations and shortened words convey meaning — and they aren’t going away anytime soon. For those who don’t text, 2G2BT means too good to be true, rly means really, r u sure means are you sure, and 4 real means for real.

**III. (The marketing is fine, but the neighborhood is questionable.)**
Because the supervisor is present, the speaker should steer clear of slang such as epic (impressive, great), sketchy (borderline, not quite safe or correct) and whassup (a short form of What’s up? or What’s going on?). The third statement is fine.

**I. and II. (I. Saturday okay with you? Maybe the beach? Or the playground? Could be fun.**
II. How about I take the kids to the beach or the playground on Saturday for a fun afternoon?) Parents are peers, so conversational English, which you see in Statements I and II, is fine. Statement III (Would it be permissible for me to take our children on an excursion this Saturday, perhaps to the beach or to the playground, so that they can amuse each other for a while?) is far too formal and stiff. A parent on the receiving end of Statement III would dress the kid in a tuxedo and send him out in a limo — if the parent let him go at all! Inappropriately formal language sometimes masks intention or meaning and may raise suspicions, even though none are warranted.

843.
**I. and II. (I. get me file asap; II. need file now)**
When a boss speaks to an assistant, the boss has more power and can break the rules of conventional grammar, as long as the intended meaning is clear. The first and second statements are okay, assuming the assistant knows which file the boss wants. (ASAP is a common acronym meaning as soon as possible. It’s safe to assume that most people understand it.) Statement III (file – now) doesn’t have enough information. Does the boss want the assistant to file something away for the boss, work on the file, or bring it to the boss? More than one meaning is possible, so Statement III isn’t acceptable.

**I. (ATM card no good. What to do?)**
Daughters and mothers are in the same family, so informality is fine, as long as the mother understands the daughter’s message. ATM – short for Automated Teller Machine — is a commonly used acronym and more likely to be comprehensible than the long ver- sion. Statement I works, as it explains the situation. Statement II (ATM no good. ??), however, is vague. Is one particular machine broken, or is the card faulty? Two different possibilities exist, with two different remedies — go to a different ATM or call the bank and find out what’s wrong with the card. Statement III (ATM?) is even foggier. The question may be Can I go to an ATM? Where is an ATM? How do I use an ATM? or something else.

Class notes are personal. The person who takes the notes has to understand what they mean. Class notes are also fast, because you’re trying to capture speech, and speech is always faster than writing or typing. If you don’t develop a system of abbreviations (b/c for because and s/b for should be are useful ones), you’ll miss the teacher’s next point while you’re recording the previous statement. That’s why Statement II (They went to war because the border was drawn where it should not have been) is wrong; it’s just too wordy and inefficient.

When you’re dealing with people whose English is minimal, stay away from expres- sions that use language creatively, not literally. Statements II and III don’t work in this situation because sound off and kick it up a notch (which both request an increase in volume) fall into the “creative” or “figurative” category. (Can you imagine a guide won- dering where to kick?) Also, the speaker doesn’t know the tour guide, presumably, and Statements II and III may be interpreted as rude; neither includes please. Statement I is clear and polite, a good combination for any tourist and, in fact, for any person.

## Tricky Word Traps
T he road to proper English is full of potholes, including words with vastly different mean- ings that resemble each other in spelling or sound and words that many people use interchangeably — and incorrectly. In this chapter you perfect your ability to tell these “twins” apart and smooth the highway to better speech and writing. 

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these types of questions:
✓	Distinguishing between words such as passed and past that sound nearly the same
✓	Using almost-look-alikes such as farther and further correctly
✓	Selecting possessives and contractions (their and they’re, its and it’s) as needed
✓	Placing commonly misused words (if and whether, like and as) in their proper context

## What to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Accept means “to agree or to take”; except means “other than.” Related forms are
­acceptance and exception.
✓	In common usage, affect is a verb meaning “to influence,” and effect is a noun meaning
“a result.” Effect is sometimes used as a verb meaning “to bring about,” as in to effect
change.
✓	Farther measures distance; further means “additional.”
✓	As a noun, principal is the head of a school or one of the most important people in a
given situation; as an adjective it also means “most important.” A principle is a “rule or
standard.”
✓	Stationary refers to something that’s fixed in one place; stationery is school or office
supplies, especially paper and envelopes.
✓	To compliment is “to praise,” and to complement is “to complete, to bring to a better
level.” Related forms are complimentary (which may mean either “praising” or “free”)
and complementary.
128
✓	A historic event is an important moment in history, the record or study of the
past. Historical refers to anything related to the past. The noun past refers to
everything up until the present moment; past as an adverb means “in front
of” or “by.” Passed is a verb meaning “moved by or along” in time or space.
✓	A capitol is a building where government meets; the capital is the city where
the government is located. Capital also refers to money for investing and
may, as an adjective, mean “chief, most important.”
✓	There refers to a place, their shows possession, and they’re means “they are.”
✓	To is a preposition, two is a number, and too means “also” or “excessive.”
✓	Since refers to time, and because to a reason. If begins a statement about a
condition or possibility, and whether presents two alternatives (whether or
not).
✓	Unique means “one of a kind” and is an absolute term. Unusual or rare are
better words when something is odd, but not unique.
✓	Disinterested means “fair and impartial,” and uninterested means
“not interested.”
✓	Like may be a verb (meaning “to appreciate or enjoy”) or a preposition. It
may not introduce a subject-verb statement; to introduce subject-verb pairs,
use as or as though.
✓	Try and works only when you’re discussing two actions; otherwise, use try to.
✓	You emigrate when you leave a country and immigrate when you enter a
country. Related words are emigrant, emigration, immigrant, and immigration.
✓	A number of means “some,” but the number usually refers to a specific
­quantity.
✓	When you hint at something, you imply; when you figure out what the hint
means, you infer.
✓	Kind of or sort of means “type of.” Don’t use these expressions as substitutes
for rather, somewhat, or a bit.


## Distinguishing between Words Resembling Each Other
### 852–881 Which of the underlined words, if any, are used correctly in these expressions?

852.	 I.

moving **to** a new house


II.

putting on **there** shoes


III.

**it’s** a shame

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

852.
**I. and III. (I. moving to a new house; III. it’s a shame)**
The preposition to in Expression I correctly tells you where the moving is headed (to a new house). There indicates place, not ownership, so Expression II (putting on there shoes) should say their shoes, not there. The contraction it’s means it is, so Expression III is correct.

III.

<details>

853.
**III. (accept the offer)**
Expression I (taking you’re time) is incorrect because you’re means “you are.” Here you need the possessive, your. Expression II (thinks two much) should be too much, to show excessive thinking. (Two is a number.) Only Expression III is correct, because accept means “agree.”

<details>

854.
**I. and III. (I. you’re right, not wrong; III. everyone except Tom)**
You’re means “you are,” which fits nicely into Expression I. The contraction it’s means “it is,” but you want the possessive its in Expression II (a dog and it’s bone). Expression III excludes Tom, a proper meaning of the preposition except.

<details>

855.
**III. (it’s raining)**
Expression I (too books, one on the shelf and one on the desk) is wrong because you need the number, two. Expression II (you’re right foot) is also incorrect; you’re means “you are,” but here you need the possessive your. Expression III is right because it’s is short for “it is.”

II.

III.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

856.
**I. (no one except for Henry)**
Expression I properly uses except to remove Henry from the group defined as no one. Expression II (there meeting us later) requires they’re, short for “they are,” not there (“a place”). Also incorrect is Expression III (too the mall), which should read to the mall, indicating direction.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

857.
**I. and II. (I. me too; II. it’s my turn)**
Expression I correctly includes too, which in this case means “also.” Expression II is right as well, because it’s is short for “it is.” Expression III (every activity accept swim- ming) doesn’t work because the appropriate word is except, which separates swimming from a group of other activities.

III.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

858.
**II. (bicycle losing its wheel)**
Expression I (you’re wallet) requires a possessive, your, not a contraction (you’re, short for “you are”). Expression II also requires a possessive, but this time you have one: its. Expression III (to people who form a lovely couple) refers to a number, so the word you want is two.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

859.
**I. and II. (I. styling your hair; II. in their neighborhood)**
Expressions I and II appropriately use the possessive forms your and their. Expression III (to young for that toy) mistakenly substitutes a preposition, to, for too, which means “overly.”

860.
**II. (your first job)**
Expression I (sitting over their) should include there, a place, instead of their, a posses- sive. Expression II properly employs the possessive your. Expression III (whether its true or not) needs the contraction it’s (it is), not the possessive its.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

861.
**I. and II. (I. exception to the rule; II. college acceptance)**
An exception to the rule, Expression I, refers to a time when the rule is not enforced. This one’s right. Expression II is also correct, because the college agrees to take the applicant and sends an acceptance letter. The only wrong one here is Expression III (the car over they’re), which needs there, a place, not the contraction they’re (“they are”).

862.
**III. (our school principal)**
For Expression I (cause and affect) you want cause and effect, because effect means “result.” Expression II (walking passed the bank) is also wrong; passed is a verb, but here you need past. Expression III is right; the principal is the head of the school. Tip: Remember that the principal is your pal.

<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

863.
**I. and III. (I. historians studying the past; III. special effects)**
The past (“events prior to the present time”) is what historians study, so Expression I is correct. Expression II (principals of fair play) isn’t correct because here you need principles, or “rules.” (Tip: Notice that both principle and rule end in le.) Expression III is fine, as it refers to exploding buildings, ghosts, aliens, and whatever else Hollywood experts create under the title of special effects.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

864.
**I. (time passed slowly)**
Time moves along, so the verb passed is appropriate for Expression I. Expression II ­(illness that effected her) needs affected (“influenced”), so it’s incorrect. So is Expression III (when principles scold students), where principals (“school officials”) scold, not principles (“rules or standards”).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

865.
**II. (principal reason to sign the treaty)**
Expression I (past over when promotions were announced) should say passed, as a verb of movement fits the meaning here. (The boss looked at everyone and passed over an employee.) Expression II is correct, because here you need an adjective (a descrip- tion). As an adjective, principal means “most important.” Expression III (the affect of the drought on crops) is wrong; the correct version is effect (“result”) of the drought.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

866.
**II. (the effect of Barbara’s actions)**
Expression I (the parade moved passed) already has a verb (moved), so moved passed (passed is also a verb) doesn’t make sense. The word you want is past (“in front of, by”). Expression I is wrong. Expression II is correct, as effect (“result”) works nicely here. Expression III (the dome of the capital building) improperly substitutes the city (capital) for the building (capitol).

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

867.
**I. and III. (I. heat affects the players; III. principles of sportsmanship)**
The heat “influences” (affects) the players, so Expression I is right. Expression II (capitol to invest) should be capital, because you’re talking about money. Expression III refers to “rules or standards,” so principles is correct.

<details>

868.
**I. (principal talking to the first graders)**
Expression I is correct because the school head, principal, is referred to here. Expression II (spending interest income, not capitol), though, should say capital (“money”), not capitol (“government building”). Expression III (has an affect on Max’s mood) is also wrong because you want the noun effect (“result”), not the verb affect (“to influence”).

870.
**II. and III. (II. the principles of investing; III. side effects of this medicine)**
Paris is a city, so Expression I (Paris, the capitol of France) should say capital (“the seat of government”), not capitol, which is a building. In Expression II principles properly refers to “rules or standards.” The unintended “results” (effects) mentioned in Expression III are also right.

871.
**II. (capital letters)**
Who has an educational conference? Principals (“school officials”) do. Expression I (principles’ educational conference) incorrectly substitutes principles (“rules”). Important letters are capital letters, so Expression II is fine. Expression III (passed tense verb) should be past tense verb — a verb that refers to events before the present moment.

872.
**I. and II. (I. to effect change; II. upon further consideration)**
Surprised? Effect is usually a noun meaning “result,” but it can, on rare occasions, be a verb meaning “to bring about.” Expression I is correct. So is Expression II, because you want a word meaning “additional,” and further is perfect. Expression III (not the princi- ple reason) is wrong, though; you need principal (“most important”) here. Principle is a noun meaning “rule or standard.”

873.
**I. (ran farther than a marathoner)**
Farther is the word you want for distance, so Expression I is right. Expression II (com- plements to the chef on a great meal) should be compliments (“praise”), not comple- ments (“what completes or makes better”). Expression III (historic novels, including those with little readership or influence) improperly substitutes historic (“of major importance”) for historical (“referring to history”).

**II. and III. (II. historical documents; III. complimentary tickets)**
You buy stationery (“office supplies”), not stationary (“fixed, unmoving”), so Expression I (stationary for class, including an extra package of paper) is wrong. Expression II works because documents created in the past are historical — “a record of history.” Expression III is a winner because the tickets are “free,” or complimentary.

**II. (stationery store having a back-to-school sale)**
Expression I (curtains in complimentary colors) is wrong; it should say complementary colors — colors that go well with other items in the room and improve the overall look. Expression II is perfect, because a stationery store sells school and office supplies. Expression III (the principals of good writing) fails because principals are school officials or important participants in a situation. Principles (“rules”) is what you want here. Expression III is incorrect.

879.
**III. (needing further study)**
Paper goods, including wedding invitations, are sold in stationery stores, so Expression I (shopping for wedding invitations at a stationary store) is faulty. Expression II (comple- mentary gift when you spend more than $500 on merchandise) also fails because compli- mentary (“free”) is the word you want here. Only Expression III makes the grade, because further means “additional.”

**I. (compliments for the hero)**
Expression I is correct; a compliment is a bit of praise, something a hero should receive. Expression II (further south along this road) isn’t, because farther is the word you want for distance. Expression III (historical first human step on the moon) is also problematic, because the first human step on the moon was extremely important in history — in other words, historic.

**Because, unusual, no change (Because birds can fly, they see the world from an unusual**

The sentence mentions that humans can attain a bird’s point of view from airplane windows, so unusual (or rare or a similar word) is ­appropriate, not unique. If is fine in this sentence because it introduces a condition.

**Try to, as if, no change (Try to look as if you were born here; don’t let the tourists know**
you’re a recent immigrant to this country.) One action is the point here, so the proper expression is try to. Like shouldn’t intro- duce a subject-verb expression (you were born), so as if is better. Immigrant works because the person being ordered around in this sentence came to this country.

**No change, too, no change (Robbie implied that the phone bill was too high as he**
remarked, “I could fly there and talk in person for less!”) To imply is “to hint,” as Robbie’s remark does. Two is a number, and the sentence calls for too, which means “overly.” As properly introduces the subject-verb statement (he remarked).

**uninterested, no change, rather (Yawning to show that she was uninterested, Jasmine**
made a number of attempts to be excused from the meeting, which was rather boring.) Disinterested means “fair,” and in this sentence you need uninterested. A number of means “some,” a good fit here. Sort of, which means “type of,” isn’t properly placed here; substitute rather (or somewhat or a similar expression).

**No change, emigrate, no change (Deciding whether to emigrate from the country where he**

Two alternatives (to leave or not to leave) appear here, so whether works well in this sentence. Emigrate is “to leave one’s country,” so immigrate is misused in this sen- tence. The number of refers to a specific (though unspecified) number of visas, so that expression is correct in this context.

To imply is “to hint.” To infer is “to deduce,” what you do when you figure out a mystery. A number of means “some” — the meaning you want in this sentence.

**rather, uninteresting, two (Mark was rather happy when the uninteresting professor left**

Kind of means “type of,” not the meaning you want here. Substitute rather, an expres- sion that limits Mark’s happiness. (You can also choose somewhat.) Disinterested is “fair,” but the sentence calls for uninteresting. (You can also substitute any synonym for boring.) Finally, you need a number (two), not too, which means “overly.”

# Chapter 21
## Seeing Double: Confusing Word Pairs
You can’t always trust your eyes and ears to help you select the right word or phrase. Sometimes a single space or letter changes the meaning altogether. That word, which means “completely,” proves my point because it resembles all together, which refers to a group acting “in unison.” To make your life even more difficult, some expressions that you see everywhere, such as alot and could of, don’t exist in Standard English. In this chapter you sharpen your English skills by concentrating on spacing and spelling, so that your word choices will always be correct.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on these skills:
✓	Selecting the proper word or phrase for a particular context
✓	Eliminating words that aren’t correct in Standard English

## What to Watch Out For 
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Altogether means “completely”; all together means “in unison” or “gathered in the same
place.”
✓	Some time refers to a period of time; sometime means “at some point in the future”;
sometimes means “occasionally.” Someday and anytime are adverbs referring to an
unspecified time in the future. Some day is a noun (day) with a description (some). It
means “an unnamed day”; any time (also a noun + a description) means “any amount of
time.” Someplace is an adverb meaning “somewhere”; some place is a noun-description
combo that refers to an unspecified location.
✓	Every day means “each day”; everyday means “ordinary or common.”
✓	Already means “so soon” or “by this time”; all ready means “completely prepared.”
✓	These words, though common, aren’t Standard English expressions: alright, alot, might
of, could of, would of, should of, might could, eachother, hisself, theyselves, theirselves,
anywheres, nowheres, and etc., had of, had ought, this here, that there.

## Selecting the Correct One- or Two-Word Expression
### 907–923 Which of the underlined expressions, if any, are correct?

907.	 I.

**already** finished, and it’s only 9 o’clock


II.

thinking about you **every day**


III.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

907.
**I. and II. (I. already finished, and it’s only 9 o’clock; II. thinking about you every day)**
Already means “so soon” or “by this time.” It’s used correctly in Expression I. Expression II is right, too, as every day refers to today, tomorrow, the day after that — in other words, every single day. Altogether as one word means “completely,” so it’s 901–1,001 misused in Expression III (the choir, altogether in the rehearsal hall, waiting to perform). There you need all together, that is, the entire group in one spot.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

908.
**I. and II. (I. to meet again someday; II. every body in the morgue)**
An adverb referring to an unspecified time, someday, fits nicely in Expression I. Every body is the right term for Expression II, because you’re talking about bodies. (If you want to write about an entire group of people, use the single word, everybody.) Expression III (seven snacks, already for the children’s lunchboxes) is wrong; it works better with all ready — the entire group of snacks prepared, no further work required.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

909.
**II. (not hungry because she’s eaten already)**
Expression I (visits his uncle some times) is faulty because the intended meaning is “occasionally,” so sometimes is the proper word. Expression II correctly explains that she’s eaten before this time, a definition of already. Expression III (the entire jury, alto- gether in the courtroom) is wrong; when a group is assembled in one spot, they’re all together. The single word, altogether, means “completely” — not the meaning you need for this statement.

910.
**I. and II. (I. altogether corrupt, not a shred of honesty left; II. everyday dishes, not the**
ones for special guests) Expression I works well with altogether, which means “completely.” Expression II is another winner, as everyday means “ordinary.” Expression III (spending sometime on exam prep) falls short because sometime as one word means “at an unspecified time.” Here you want some time, a period of time — say, an hour — for exam prep.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

911.
**III. (everybody on the staff, with no exceptions)**
The intended meaning of Expression I (some times sings professionally) is “occasion- ally,” so the adverb needed here is sometimes. Expression II (to be a star some day) is incorrect, too, because some day as two words refers to a particular day (Tuesday, for example) that isn’t named. As a single word, someday means “at an unspecified time.” Expression III is fine, as everybody refers to the whole group.

</details>

912.
**II. and III. (II. everyday chores, but nothing extra; III. buying some place on 16th Street)**
Expression I (the family, altogether) refers to the family gathered as a group, so all together is appropriate, not the single word altogether, which means “completely.” Expression II properly uses everyday to mean “common or ordinary.” Expression III is correct as well, as some place means “a place.”

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

913.
**I. (a fitness plan for every body with a few extra pounds on it)**
In the context of Expression I, every body makes sense, because you’re talking about physical bodies. Expression II (to meet someday next week, but not Monday) is wrong because the context (but not Monday) emphasizes a day. Therefore, some day is a better choice. Expression III (books Maxine read all ready but would like to read again) needs already, because the context requires “by this time” or “before this point in time.” 901–1,001

914.
**I. and II. (I. someplace to relax, such as a spa; II. a document that is altogether meaning-**
less, as if it were written by a two-year-old) Expression I is fine, because the sentence requires an adverb (someplace) to describe relax. Expression II properly inserts altogether (“completely”) to explain exactly how meaningless the document is. Expression III (calling any time) mistakenly uses a noun (time) and a description (any) where you need an adverb, anytime.

915.
**I. (all ready for the trip — bags packed and passport renewed)**
Expression I is a winner because all ready means “completely prepared,” which describes the situation here. Expression II (every day negotiations, nothing historic) fails because you’re not talking about a day; instead you need a word meaning “ordinary,” and everyday fits perfectly. Expression III (if the boss has anytime this week) wrongly places the adverb anytime where you need a noun (time) and a description (any). The intended meaning is “a period of time.”

916.
**All of the expressions**
The fitness fanatic in Expression I (lifting weights every day) doesn’t take a break from lifting weights day after day. Therefore, every day works here. Expressions II and III (hoping to run for office sometime and planning to meet Helen someday) correctly rely on the adverbs sometime and someday to refer to an unspecified time in the future.

**II. (permission to log on to the computer sometimes)**
Expression I (dressed-up seniors, already for the prom) fails because the seniors are pre- pared, or all ready, for their big celebration.

918.
**I. (getting revenge someday)**
Expression I correctly points to an unspecified time in the future with the adverb some- day. Altogether (“completely”) makes more sense in Expression II (a plan that is all together ambitious and inspiring) than all together, which means “in unison.” Expression III (devoting anytime to volunteer work) is also wrong, as it requires any time to refer to a period of time.

919.
**I. and II. (I. finding some place in the orchestra, perhaps in the string section; II. everyday**
challenges for elderly residents) The noun-description combo, some place, is perfect here, because you’re talking about a spot in the orchestra. Therefore, Expression I is correct. Expression II also works, because everyday means “ordinary,” the sort of challenges any elderly person might encounter. Expression III (going out because I all ready did my homework) is wrong, as already (“by this time”) is the word you want. 901–1,001

920.
**III. (call anytime, day or night)**
The group huddled under the awning is all together, or “gathered,” so Expression I (sheltering from the storm, altogether under the awning) is wrong. (Altogether means “completely.”) Expression II (asking for sometime off from work) wrongly puts an adverb, sometime, where you need a noun and a description (some time). Anytime, in Expression III, is a winner; in this context the adverb means “at all times.”

921.
**I. (my sometime friend, now my enemy)**
Expression I relies on a rare, older meaning of sometime, “once.” This expression talks about someone who was once a friend but now isn’t. Expression II (Everyday of the week) is wrong because you’re talking about days, which is a noun. Therefore you need a noun-description combo, every day. Expression III (all together majestic and inspiring) is wrong because the context requires a word meaning “completely” (altogether).

**I. and III. (I. vampires, not altogether dead; III. nine months old and walking already)**
Vampires in films and novels aren’t completely, or altogether, dead. Therefore, Expression I is correct. Expression II (film making its debut someday next month) is wrong because it requires a noun and a description (some day), not the adverb, some- day. The debut will be on a particular day. Expression III is a winner, because already may mean “so soon.”

**I. and II. (I. may burst out laughing at any time; II. has sometimes acted on Broadway)**
Expression I is right because you need a noun (time) to act as the object of the prepo- sition at. Expression II is also fine because sometimes means “occasionally.” Expression III (danced, altogether, in the chorus line) is wrong; altogether means “completely,” but here you need all together (“in unison”).

# Chapter 22
## Steering Clear of Incorrect Expressions
I’m the first to admit that some grammar rules make no sense. When my students ask why they have to place a comma in a certain spot or change a word, sometimes my only answer is because you do. End of story! Occasionally, though, grammar rests on a logical framework. In this chapter you tackle a few rules in that category, as well as a couple that represent nothing more than tradition.

## The Questions You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you work on questions that focus on the following skills:
✓	Selecting expressions that are correct in Standard English
✓	Avoiding double negatives
✓	Distinguishing between the verbs rise and raise, sit and set, and lie and lay

## Watch to Watch Out For
Keep these points in mind when you’re answering the questions in this chapter:
✓	Different than isn’t generally accepted in formal usage. Use different from, followed by a noun.
✓	The reason is because is incorrect in Standard English. Use the reason is that or simply
state the reason, introduced by because.
✓	Irregardless and being that aren’t Standard English expressions. Try regardless, despite,
or because.
✓	In some languages, the more negatives you include, the more emphatically you’re deny-
ing the point. In English, though, double negatives are a no-no because the two nega-
tives equal a positive statement. Avoid can’t hardly, can’t scarcely, can’t help but, and
can’t but. Go for can hardly, can scarcely, can’t help (plus the -ing form of a verb, as in
can’t help snooping), and can only.
✓	The English language distinguishes between what you measure (sugar, for example, or
loyalty) and what you count (shoes or years, perhaps). Measuring words include amount,
less, little, and much. To count, select number of, fewer, few, and many. A few words
(more, all, any, no, and some) work for both measuring and counting. Between and among
are prepositions; use between when you have two people or things (between home and
school) and among when you have more than two (among 50 musicians).
140
✓	Rise means “to get up, to lift oneself.” Use raise when you’re lifting something (or some-
one!) else. Rise is an irregular verb: rise, rose, rising, risen. Raise is regular: raise, raising,
raised.
✓	Sit is what you do when you place yourself in a chair or another surface. Set means
“to place,” and it refers to an action you perform on something else. Sit is irregular: sit,
­sitting, sat. Set is also irregular: set, setting, set.
✓	Lie means “to rest or recline.” Lay is “to place, to put down.” These verbs are devilish
because the past tense of lie is lay. The past participle is lain. The past tense of lay is
laid, which is also the past participle.


## Avoiding Double Negatives and Other Errors
### 952–971 How should the underlined words be changed, if at all, to create a correct sentence?

952.	 **Don’t** not mix business with pleasure, **being that** you’re **not on** duty now.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

952.
**Do, because, no change (Do not mix business with pleasure, because you’re not on duty**
now.) Don’t (short for do not) is negative and shouldn’t precede not. Otherwise your sentence says, “Do not not . . . .” Being that is not Standard English. Change it to because, as, or a similar word. (Don’t substitute since. Although many people equate since and because, since is actually a time word.) You’re is positive, so you’re not presents no problems.

953.
**anything, no change, school (May didn’t know anything about spelling, and her handwrit-**
ing was different from ours because she never attended school.) The contraction didn’t (short for did not) is already negative, so nothing creates a double negative. Change it to anything. Different from is correct. Never is negative, so no school also creates a double negative. Drop no and the problem is solved.

954.	 **Being that** it’s summer, you **can’t** expect no freezing rain or **different** weather.

954.
**Because, can, no change (Because it’s summer, you can expect no freezing rain or differ-**
ent weather.) Being that isn’t Standard English; you can substitute because or as or considering that. (Don’t use since, which is a time word.) Can’t is negative, but the sentence already mentions no freezing, so change can’t to can. Different, in this sentence, is fine all by itself.

955.	 Greta **didn’t know** nothing, wouldn’t do **nothing**, and **refused any** help.

955.
**knew, anything, no change (Greta knew nothing, wouldn’t do anything, and refused any**
help.) Didn’t is negative, and so is nothing. To eliminate the double negative, change didn’t know to knew. The next verb, wouldn’t do, is also negative and shouldn’t pair with the negative word nothing. Change nothing to anything, and you’re fine. Refused means “said no to,” but any isn’t negative, so no double negative pops up here. 901–1,001

956.
**can get, no change, no change (Mick can get no satisfaction when he complains to**
Customer Service that he hasn’t received any new guitars, although he has paid for three.) Can’t is a negative (short for cannot), so no creates a double negative. Insert can get in place of can’t get and the double negative disappears. Hasn’t (short for has not) is nega- tive, but here it’s properly followed by any. No change is needed. Nor do you have to change has paid, which is simply a positive statement.

**any lies, regardless, anything (Zach won’t tell any lies, regardless of who’s asking for**
information, so do not explain anything to him.) Won’t (short for will not) is negative, but so is no. Change no lies to lies to eliminate the double negative. Irregardless isn’t correct in Standard English; substitute regardless. Do not is negative, and nothing creates a double negative. Change nothing to anything to correct the sentence.

958.
**No changes (The dog should give you no trouble, being a gentle animal, unless you do not**
feed him.) Should give is positive, so it doesn’t conflict with no trouble. Being is a fine word when it doesn’t pair up with that to form being that, a nonstandard expression. The next verb is negative, but it’s not a double. All is correct in this sentence.

<details>

959.
**No changes (No, Ellie did not tell her aunt that Karl had completed nothing.)**
The first no is separated from the sentence by a comma, so it functions as an introduc- tion to the sentence and doesn’t create a double negative. The other two verbs are correct.

**can’t help thinking, no change, different from (Jacques can’t help thinking that, regard-**
less of salary, his work is no different from his boss’s.) Can’t help but think is a double negative; change it to can’t help thinking. Regardless is correct, but different than is nonstandard. Substitute different from.

Being that isn’t correct in Standard English. Substitute because or as or a similar word. (Don’t use since, which is a time word.) Shouldn’t is negative, so it can’t pair with no candy. Change it to should have. Never also creates a double negative (actually, the original is a triple negative!). Substituting ever solves the problem. 901–1,001

963.
**anything, regardless, couldn’t help charging (Steve claimed that he had not done any-**
thing; regardless, the district attorney couldn’t help charging him with burglary.) The expression had not done is negative, so nothing creates a double negative. Change nothing to anything and the problem is solved. Irregardless is nonstandard; substitute regardless. Couldn’t is a negative word, and so is but. Together they make another double negative. Use couldn’t help charging instead.

**No change, no change, had (Walter’s approach to the problem was different from**
Hannah’s, but he had expected no criticism from her.) Different from is Standard English, as is the use of but as a conjunction. No changes for these two! However, hadn’t (short for had not) is negative, and so is no criticism. To eliminate the double negative, use had instead of hadn’t.

**any, no change, no change (Don’t you know any better, regardless of the fact that you**
haven’t been taught manners in a formal way?) Don’t (short for do not) is negative, so it makes a poor pair with no better. Substitute any better for no better and the sentence is, well, better! Regardless and haven’t are cor- rect here.

966.
**that, could, no change (The reason Nick moved is that he could hardly stand his supervi-**
sor’s denial of any guilt.) The reason is . . . that is correct, not the reason is . . . because. Couldn’t hardly is a double negative, which you correct by changing couldn’t to could. Any is fine in the context of this sentence.

967.
**No changes (No engineer but Martin has ever stepped in that room, and you can hardly**
blame him for bragging about his courage.) Everything works in this sentence. The first no establishes a group, and the preposi- tion but properly removes Martin from that group. The adverb ever, which means “at any time,” properly describes the verb has stepped. Can hardly is a proper English expression.

**No change, no change, ever (Do you know neither Latin nor Greek, or haven’t you ever**

971.
**had only, could hardly, no change (King Leo had only five knights, and winning the war**
was something he could hardly imagine, except under different and unlikely circumstances.) Hadn’t but is a double negative; go for had only or had but instead. Couldn’t hardly is also a double negative that should be changed to could hardly. (Another way to correct this expression is to delete hardly.) In the context of this sentence, different is fine as written.

## Counting and Measuring Words
### 972–986 How should the underlined words be changed, if at all, to create a correct sentence?

972.
**many, no change, no change (Imelda has many shoes, far more than Jessie, but less time**
to shop.) You can count shoes, so many is the word you want here. (Much is for things you mea- sure, such as much salt.) More both counts and measures; in this sentence, it’s a count- ing word. Less is a measuring word, so less time makes sense.

**fewer, no change, many (Put fewer books on that shelf, which appears less sturdy than the**

**No change, no change, fewer (The soup needs a little pepper to spice it up; be sure to pre-**

**among, no change, much (Let’s keep the secret among the three of us, because if more**
people know, our error will attract much attention.) Between is appropriate when you have two elements, but here you have the three of us, so among is the correct preposition. More is a great, all-purpose word, proper for both counting (the situation here) and measuring. Because you measure, not count, atten- tion, you need much, not many. 901–1,001

977.
**number, more, no change (Considering the number of hours I spent adding more vocabu-**
lary words to my flash cards, I should have scored much higher on the test.) Generally you measure time, but here time is broken into hours, which you count. Therefore, number is better than amount. Much doesn’t work with vocabulary words, because you count them. More or many is a better choice. Did you stumble over the last underlined word? True, you count points to figure out a score, but here you’re dealing with the abstract concept higher, so much is better. Tip: Never attach more to a comparative term such as higher.

978.
**No change, no change, between (When Jack is among friends, he is less nervous than**
when the conversation is between him and only one other person.) Among is the preposition for groups of three or more; between is the preposition for a pair. In this sentence, the first underlined word applies to friends, and the third applies to him and only one other person. Therefore, you want among friends and between him and only one other person. The middle part of this question correctly attaches less to nervous. Less and least create negative comparisons — less for a comparison between two elements and least for three or more.

979.
**No change, less, no change (This dial shows the amount of electricity consumed, which is**
less than last year but much more than the goal we set.) Electricity is measured, so amount is properly placed here. Less, an adjective, is cor- rectly used after the linking verb is. Lesser is a noun, as in the lesser of two evils, and doesn’t fit this context. The third underlined expression is tricky. More adapts to both measured and counted elements, so more electricity (the implied meaning) is correct. Much is an adverb, intensifying the abstract quality more. It, too, is correct in this sentence.

**Among, no change, no change (Among your options are law, banking, and education. The**
first two guarantee many salary increases, but the last may give you more success.) Three options appear, so among, a preposition for a group of three or more, is proper. Many is correct because it applies to increases, not to salary. More is one of those won- derful words that work for both counting and measuring.

**No change, no change, less (Dr. Henry pays much attention to his students, though he**

**much less, no change, no change (Charlie and Rose have much less money between them**
than they’d like, but it is as much as they need.) In theory you count money, so many fewer seems correct. However, the singular word money is more abstract than, say, dollars, so it merits the measuring words much less. Between is correct because you’re talking about two people. Much is a pronoun here, referring to the money. 901–1,001

**No change, fewer, no change (Many have complained that the rugs have fewer natural**
fibers and soil more easily than they used to.) The pronoun many represents people, so this counting word is correct. You can count fibers, so fewer is proper and less isn’t. More creates a comparison with the word it’s attached to (easily) and is also correct. The two-word comparative forms of adjectives and adverbs always rely on more and less.

**No change, many, no change (Sayed had much to be thankful for, such as many friends,**
few enemies, and a loving family.) Much is generally a measuring word, but friends, enemies, and family appear to be things you count. However, much in this sentence applies to the idea of thankfulness, even though that word doesn’t appear in the sentence. The second underlined word should be many, as it’s attached to friends — definitely something you count. You can also count enemies, so few works fine with that noun.

## Strange Verb Pairs
### 987–1,001 Which of these expressions, if any, is grammatically correct?

987.
**I. (raise the flag)**
To raise is “to lift,” and when you raise the flag, you lift it on the flagpole. Expression I is correct. Expression II (lay down for a nap now) is wrong because to lay is “to place, to put down.” Here you want lie, which means “to rest or recline.” Expression III (setting on the chair) fails because sitting is what you’re doing when you’re plopped on a chair. To set is “to place.”

988.
**II. (the sun, which rose at 5 a.m.)**
To set is “to place,” the meaning you need in Expression I (sit the fragile antique desk in the corner). Sit, in this context, is wrong. Expression II is correct because the sun rose (“lifted itself”). Expression III (has laid in bed for ten hours) should be has lain, because that’s the present perfect form of the verb to lie, which means “to rest or recline.”

989.
**II. and III. (II. who had sat in the shade on a blanket; III. laid railroad tracks near the**
station) The audience members lift themselves to a standing position, so rising (“lifting oneself”) is the proper verb for Expression I (the audience, raising for a standing ovation), not raising. Had sat, in Expression II, is correct. The past perfect form of to sit is had sat. Expression III is fine as well, because someone placed railroad tracks, and laid is the past-tense form of to lay. 901–1,001

990.
**III. (raised the shelf two inches higher)**
To set is “to place,” so in Expression I (because yesterday he sat the birdcage near a window) you need that verb, not to sit. The proper form here is he set the birdcage. Has lain, in Expression II (has lain the picnic basket on the ground), is also wrong, because you need the present perfect form of to lay (“to place”), which is has laid. Expression III is a winner: to raise is “to lift,” and here someone raised (“lifted”) the shelf.

991.
**II. and III. (II. rise for the singing of the national anthem; III. lay down for a nap about an**
hour ago) An informal expression often used in the South, to set a spell isn’t correct in formal English. Use it in conversation if you want, but in formal writing, you need sitting for a while or a similar phrase. Therefore, Expression I (setting a spell, to relax) is wrong. Rise is correct in Expression II, because people lift themselves to their feet for the anthem, and to rise is “to lift oneself.” Expression III employs lay, the past-tense form of to lie (“to rest or recline”).

992.
**I. and II. (I. peasants rose in rebellion; II. laid flowers in front of the shrine)**
The peasants “lifted themselves up” to oppose the rulers, so rose, the past tense of to rise, is correct in Expression I. Expression II is right because laid is the past tense of to lay, which means “to place.” Expression III (has set still for the photographer) is wrong; has sat is the present perfect form of to sit, and you sit still when your picture is being taken.

993.
**II. and III. (II. raises an important point at the meeting; III. the diamond, set in a gold ring)**
You know you need past tense in Expression I (lay the suitcase on the bench and left it there) because one of the verbs, left, is in that tense. The past tense of to lay (“to put or place”) is laid, not lay, which is the past tense of to lie (“to rest or recline”). Therefore, Expression I is incorrect. Expression II properly includes the verb raises, because when you raise a point, you bring it up. (Of course, in this context the movement isn’t physi- cal.) Expression III is right because the diamond was placed, or set, in a gold ring.

994.
**II. (sitting in the principal’s office, waiting for an appointment)**
You place carpet on a floor, so the verb form you need in Expression I (lying carpet on the floor) is laying (“putting or placing”), not lying. Expression II is fine; you’re in a chair, waiting, so you’re sitting. Expression III (Raise and shine! It’s time to get out of bed!) refers to getting up in the morning, so you want rise, not raise.

995.
**I. (robbers lying in wait for a victim)**
The robbers are resting, as they wait for a victim. They are, as Expression I says, lying. Expression II (has laid on the sofa, pretending to sleep) should read has lain, as that’s the present perfect form of to lie (“to rest or recline”). Expression III (sitted on the window ledge) has the right verb (to sit) but the wrong form. The past tense of to sit is sat. 901–1,001

**III. (his rising hope, as he listened to those encouraging words)**
You place, or set decorations in the carton, so Expression I (will sit the decorations in the carton, ready for storage) doesn’t work. Was lain in Expression II (was lain to rest in the town cemetery) is incorrect. After death, the body is laid to rest, or “placed” in the cem- etery. Expression III properly uses rising, as hope increases, or lifts, by itself, even if encouraging words are a motivating factor.

997.
**I. and III. (I. set aside funds for college tuition; III. laying eggs)**
Expression I refers to placing money in a special account in order to pay for college tuition. Therefore, set, or “place,” is correct. Expression II (stirring yeast into the mixture and waiting for the bread to raise) is wrong because the bread rises, or “lifts,” by itself, once the yeast is present. Expression III is correct. The hen doesn’t appear in this phrase, but she’s “placing” her eggs in the nest, or laying them.

998.
**II. (sat on a jury)**
If you’re not moving a muscle, as Expression I (laying still, not moving a muscle) says, you’re lying (“resting”), not laying (“placing”). Expression II is a little strange, but it’s correct. You must sit down in the jury box during a trial, so sat (the past tense of to sit), is the right verb. You lift your own expectations to a higher level, according to Expression III (rising your expectations and doing better work as a result), so raising is proper here.

**I. and II. (I. raise money for the homeless; II. had set goals for himself)**
When a charity asks for money, it’s trying to raise, or “lift” the amount available. Expression I is correct. So is Expression II, which talks about a man who had set, or “had put in place,” goals for himself. Expression III (plants laying dormant for the winter) is wrong; it should read lying dormant, as the plants are “resting” for the winter. 1,
