# simple past tense

In this sentence the busy Mr. Martin is doing two things, trimming and watering, but these actions occur at different times. **Standard English** requires that the **earlier action**, the watering, be in **past perfect tense** (had watered). The action that occurs **second** is expressed in **simple past tense**, trimmed.
