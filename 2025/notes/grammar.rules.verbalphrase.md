# Verbal Phrases
A verbal phrase is any phrase that begins with a verb but doesn't act as a main verb in the sentence. It can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb. Verbal phrases can include participles, infinitives, and gerunds.



- Participial Phrases: These are verbal phrases that begin with a participle (a verb form that functions as an adjective).
- Infinitive Phrases: These begin with an infinitive verb (to + base verb) and can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.
- Gerund Phrases: These start with a gerund (a verb form ending in -ing that functions as a noun).

## Example of Verbal Phrases:
Running in the park (Gerund phrase, functioning as a noun)
To swim in the ocean (Infinitive phrase, functioning as a noun)
Having finished my homework (Participial phrase, functioning as an adjective)
