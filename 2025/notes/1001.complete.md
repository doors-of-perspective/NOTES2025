# Chapter 1
## Time Travel: Identifying the Verb and Choosing the Correct Tense
In science fiction films, a character can zoom into the past or hop into the future, usually with the help of a machine resembling a giant vacuum cleaner. You time travel too, when you choose verbs for your sentences. Verbs express action or state of being in the past, present, and future. In this chapter you practice locating the verb and selecting the appropriate tense. You also tackle singular and plural forms, plugging the right one into every sentence.

## The Questions You'll Answer
Here you find sentences that allow you to sharpen your verb skills in these ways:
✓ Locating the verb(s) in a sentence
✓ Selecting simple past-, present-, or future-tense verbs to fit the meaning of a sentence
✓ Choosing progressive verb forms to indicate ongoing action
✓ Placing past perfect, present perfect, or future perfect forms where they’re needed
✓ Finding the right tense to summarize speech and discuss literary or artistic works
✓ Expressing unchangeable facts in present tense
✓ Determining whether you need a singular or plural form

## What to Watch Out For

Verb tense can be tricky, as can agreement — the matching of singular verbs to singular 
subjects and plural verbs to plural subjects. When you work through these questions, 
watch out for these issues:

✓ Zero in on the time period(s) covered in the sentence.
✓ Establish a timeline if more than one action or state of being is expressed in the 
sentence.
✓ Stay in the same tense unless the meaning of the sentence justifies a shift.
✓ Check whether the subject is singular or plural and match the verb to the subject.
✓ Ignore words that resemble verbs but function as descriptions or nouns.


## Locating the Verb
### 1–15 Identify the verb(s) in the sentence.

<details>

1.
**played**
The only word expressing action in this sentence is played, which is therefore the only verb.

3.	 The twins will be happy on their birthday when they receive your present!

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

3.
**will be, receive**
The first verb, will be, links a state of being — happy — to the twins. The second is an action verb, receive.

</details>

4.	 Perhaps because of my brother’s illness, my dog Tweet seems sad today.

<details>

4.
**seems**
The verb seems links a state of being — sad — to the subject, my dog Tweet.

</details>

Two words give you the action in this sentence: searched and found.

</details>

- 
6.	 The screaming figure at the left of the painting represents a mother’s grief.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

6.
**represents**
Although screaming and painting refer to actions, screaming functions as a description and painting as an object (a thing) in this sentence. The only verb in this sentence is represents.

</details>

- 
7.	 Glenn has always carried the sizzling pizza in a special, heat-proof box.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

7.
**has carried**
The action in this sentence is expressed by two words, has carried, which together make one verb. The word sizzling resembles a verb but serves as a description, not the action in the sentence. Are you surprised that always isn’t included in the verb? It’s an adverb, telling when the action happens.

</details>

- 
8.	 The puppies, along with the kittens, were displayed in the shop window for all to see.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

8.
**were displayed**
What happened to the puppies? They were displayed, the action verb in this sentence. Did to see trip you up? That’s an infinitive, the “head” of the verb family that never functions as the verb in a sentence.

</details>

- 
9.	 The last meeting of the council was bittersweet, as the members were now scattering for distant destinations.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

9.
**was, were scattering**
The sentence has two parts, one about the last meeting of the council and one about the actions of the members. The verb in the first part, was, expresses a state of being and links a description (bittersweet) to the subject (meeting). The verb in the second part, were scattering, tells you about the actions of the members.

</details>

- 
10.	 To go faster, try not to look at the keyboard as you type.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

10.
**try, type**
Remember that infinitives, the “to + verb” form, simply name the verb family. They never function as verbs in a sentence. The action verbs here are try and type.

</details>

- 
11.	 Smiling, Barbara wrestled with the math problem until she calculated the correct answer.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

11.
**wrestled, calculated**
The first word in the sentence, smiling, looks like an action verb. However, it functions as a description of Barbara. The true action verbs are wrestled and calculated.

</details>

- 
12.	 Daniel’s pen, having run out of ink, sat on the shelf, unused and forgotten.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

12.
**sat**
Several words in this sentence (having run, unused, forgotten) resemble verbs, but because they function as descriptions, they aren’t actually verbs. Sat is the only action verb.

</details>

- 
13.	 While copying the letter, Mike stuck his finger in the moving paper tray.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

13.
**copying, stuck**
The subject of this sentence, Mike, did two actions; he was copying and he stuck his finger in the tray. The first portion of the sentence begins with a conjunction (While), which should be followed by a subject-verb statement. Two words are missing, but Mike was copying is implied, so copying counts as an official verb.

</details>

- 
14.	 Norman has been judged “normal” by his doctor, but his friends view him differently.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

14.
**has been judged, view**
Three words make up the first verb in this sentence, has been judged, but the second idea needs only one verb, view, to express his friends’ actions.

</details>

- 
15.	 Sliding down the mountain, the ski instructor guided his students.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

15.
**guided**
The first verb form is an introductory participle. In other words, sliding is a description of ski instructor. You know it doesn’t function as a verb because it doesn’t follow a con- junction such as while, after, before, or a similar word. The action verb that pairs with ski instructor is guided, the only verb in this sentence.

## Choosing Simple and Perfect Tense Verb Forms
### 16–55 Select the tense and form of the verb in parentheses that fits the meaning of the sentence.

16.	 I _____ (to start) my blog a year ago, and I do not intend to stop now.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

16.
**started (I started my blog a year ago, and I do not intend to stop now.)**
A year ago is a time clue, telling you that the blog began in the past. The sentence includes another time clue also; now refers to a specific time, the present. The begin- ning of the blog, therefore, was in the past, as the past-tense verb started indicates.

</details>

- 
17.	 Sheryl and her friend always _____(to shop) on a Tuesday, when the store offers double discounts.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

17.
**shop (Sheryl and her friend always shop on a Tuesday, when the store offers double**
discounts.) The first clue in this sentence is always, which tells you that the action of shopping happens repeatedly. The next clue appears in the second portion of the sentence, where you find out that the store offers special discounts on Tuesdays. Because the second portion of the sentence is in present tense, the present-tense verb shop makes a good match for the third-person, plural subject Sheryl and her friend.

</details>

- 
18.	 Next year, four boys _____ (to compete) for a single spot on the wrestling team.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

18.
**will compete (Next year, four boys will compete for a single spot on the wrestling team.)**
Because the action takes place in the future, or, more specifically, next year, you need the future-tense verb will compete.

</details>

- 
19.	 Emma _____ (to snap) a picture of her brother Eric every year on his birthday, including today.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

19.
**has snapped (Emma has snapped a picture of her brother Eric every year on his birthday,**
including today.) The first time Emma snapped a picture was in the past, and she’s still active today. The tense that connects present and past is present perfect. Because only one person is doing this action, you need the singular form, has snapped.

</details>

- 
20.	 Last week I tossed a bit of my dinner under the table because the dog _____(to beg) for scraps while I ate.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

20.
**was begging (Last week I tossed a bit of my dinner under the table because the dog was**
begging for scraps while I ate.) The verb in the first portion of the sentence, tossed, indicates an action that took place while another action occurred. The singular, past progressive tense gives a sense of an action, begging, that occurred over some time. The simple past-tense form, begged, would also work here, but the immediacy of past progressive tense is better.

</details>

- 
21.	 Start working on your lab report as soon as you _____ (to arrive) home.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

21.
**arrive (Start working on your lab report as soon as you arrive home.)**
The sentence discusses two actions, arriving home and starting work on the lab report. Both occur (or should occur, according to the sentence) at more or less the same time. You have a command (start), and logic tells you that you can’t give a past- tense command such as arrived. Therefore, the best tense for the second action is present, or arrive.

</details>

- 
22.	 Mr. Martin _____ (to trim) the tree after he had watered it.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

22.
**trimmed (Mr. Martin trimmed the tree after he had watered it.)**
In this sentence the busy Mr. Martin is doing two things, trimming and watering, but these actions occur at different times. Standard English requires that the earlier action, the watering, be in past perfect tense (had watered). The action that occurs second is expressed in simple past tense, trimmed.

</details>

- 
23.	 While Harry _____ (to wash) the clothes, Oliver was brushing the dog’s matted fur.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

23.
**was washing (While Harry was washing the clothes, Oliver was brushing the dog’s**
matted fur.) The second portion of the sentence indicates that the action took place in the past (was brushing). The singular, past progressive form, was washing, works nicely here, because the actions happen at the same time and only one person was involved in the washing. (The simple past tense, washed, could also work in this sentence.)

</details>

- 
24.	 Jackie _____ (to learn) Arabic when she lived in Tunisia.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

24.
**learned (Jackie learned Arabic when she lived in Tunisia.)**
The two actions in the sentence, learned and lived, take place at the same time, so they should be in the same tense (past).

</details>

- 
25.	 Carla _____ (to fill) the gas tank before she realized that her credit card was not in her wallet.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

25.
**had filled (Carla had filled the gas tank before she realized that her credit card was not in**
her wallet.) Two actions occur in this sentence. Both are in the past, but one takes place before the other. Standard English requires that the earlier action be in past perfect tense (had filled). The action that occurs second is expressed in simple past tense, realized.

</details>

- 
26.	 By the time George gets home, Maria _____(to gobble) all the cookies, and George hates all the other snacks.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

26.
**will have gobbled (By the time George gets home, Maria will have gobbled all the cookies,**
and George hates all the other snacks.) The sentence includes a deadline — the time George gets home — and something that happens before the deadline — Maria’s snack attack. The future perfect tense, will have gobbled, is made for just such a situation.

</details>

- 
27.	 When I _____ (to bake) the cookies, I placed them on the dining room table.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

27.
**had baked (When I had baked the cookies, I placed them on the dining room table.)**
Two actions in the past show up in this sentence, the baking of the cookies and their placement on the table. Logic tells you that the baking happened before I placed the cookies somewhere other than in the oven. To move one action further in the past than another, use the past perfect tense, had baked.

</details>

- 
28.	 Although the king commands instant obedience, his followers sometimes _____(to disobey).

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

28.
**disobey (Although the king commands instant obedience, his followers sometimes**
disobey.) This sentence expresses actions that are happening now, as you learn from the first part of the sentence, which contains the present-tense verb commands. The second part of the sentence refers to an action that takes place at the same time, so simple present tense is what you want here. Because followers is plural, you need the plural form, disobey.

</details>

- 
29.	 Marlene _____ (to lecture) for two hours before she noticed that several audience members were asleep.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

29.
**had lectured (Marlene had lectured for two hours before she noticed that several audi-**
ence members were asleep.) Two actions occur in this sentence. Both are in the past, but one takes place before the other. Standard English requires that the earlier action be in past perfect tense (had lectured). The action that occurs second is expressed in simple past tense, noticed.

</details>

- 
30.	 I _____ (to live) in this neighborhood for about a year, and despite its problems, I still love my home.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

30.
**have lived (I have lived in this neighborhood for about a year, and despite its problems, I**
still love my home.) The present and past are connected in this sentence, as the speaker (I) lived in the neighborhood for the past year and continues to live there in the present. The present perfect tense connects the past and present, so have lived works perfectly in this sentence.

</details>

- 
31.	 The yellow and brown leaves began to fall; the autumn soon _____ (to end).

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

31.
**ended (The yellow and brown leaves began to fall; the autumn soon ended.)**
Simple past tense does the job here; the leaves began to fall, so you know that you’re talking about the past, and ended is a past-tense verb.

</details>

- 
32.	 No one _____ (to work) harder than Ellen, who spent eight or nine hours a day on this project for the first two weeks and is now allotting ten or twelve hours a day to it!

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

32.
**has worked (No one has worked harder than Ellen, who spent eight or nine hours a day on**
this project for the first two weeks and is now allotting ten or twelve hours a day to it!) The project began in the past and continues in the present, so present perfect tense is good here. Ellen is singular, so has worked, the singular form, is the form you want.

</details>

- 
33.	 Jared _____ (to jog) four miles every day as soon as he wakes up.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

33.
**jogs (Jared jogs four miles every day as soon as he wakes up.)**
Jared’s fitness routine is an ongoing, customary action, so present tense is best. Because Jared is one person, opt for the singular form, jogs.

</details>

- 
34.	 From now on, David _____ (to complete)his homework on time, to avoid detention and poor grades.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

34.
**will complete (From now on, David will complete his homework on time, to avoid deten-**
tion and poor grades.) The expression from now on moves the sentence into the future, so will complete is the future-tense form you want.

</details>

- 
35.	 Elliot always _____ (to return) his library books late, so he pays many fines.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

35.
**returns (Elliot always returns his library books late, so he pays many fines.)**
Your clue here is always, which indicates an ongoing action and calls for present tense. Elliot is singular, so you need the singular, present-tense form, returns.

</details>

- 
36.	 While Meredith _____ (to paint) the ceiling, a dog jumped on the ladder.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

36.
**was painting (While Meredith was painting the ceiling, a dog jumped on the ladder.)**
Because the dog jumped, you can assume that the painting took place in the past. Also, only one person (Meredith) performs the action of painting. Therefore, the singular, past progressive form was painting works well. Did you choose the simple past-tense form, painted? That form isn’t wrong, but the immediacy of the progressive is better because the word while places you in the midst of an ongoing action.

</details>

- 
37.	 Place the dough in a warm spot, and in a few hours it _____ (to double) in size.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

37.
**will double (Place the dough in a warm spot, and in a few hours it will double in size.)**
The first action in the sentence, place, is a command, so you know you are in the pres- ent. A few hours after you place the dough, you are in the future, so will double is a good fit.

</details>

- 
38.	 It _____ (to rain) every day for a month, including today, but tomorrow’s forecast calls for sunshine.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

38.
**has rained (It has rained every day for a month, including today, but tomorrow’s forecast**
calls for sunshine.) The sentence connects the past (every day for a month) to the present (including today). Present perfect tense links the present and past, and the subject, it, is singular, so the singular form has rained is a good choice. The progressive form, has been rain- ing, would also work in this sentence.

</details>

- 
39.	 The soda had soaked into the carpet by the time the janitor _____ (to arrive) with a mop.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

39.
**arrived (The soda had soaked into the carpet by the time the janitor arrived with a mop.)**
The sentence mentions two actions — soaking and arriving. The earlier action is in past perfect tense (had soaked), and the more recent action is in past tense (arrived).

</details>

- 
40.	 Right now, Catherine’s friends _____(to gather) for her surprise party.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

40.
**are gathering (Right now, Catherine’s friends are gathering for her surprise party.)**
The clue here is right now, an expression that tells you an action is happening. The present progressive form, are gathering, is what you need.

</details>

- 
41.	 Once George _____ (to chop) down the cherry tree, the fruit was lost.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

41.
**had chopped (Once George had chopped down the cherry tree, the fruit was lost.)**
Two events occur in this sentence: George’s unfortunate use of the ax and the loss of the fruit. Both happened in the past, so the earlier must be expressed by the past perfect tense, had chopped.

</details>

- 
42.	 I paid the electric bill on the 17th, so I _____ (to receive) the next bill in about a week.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

42.
**will receive (I paid the electric bill on the 17th, so I will receive the next bill in about a**
week.) The first portion of the sentence talks about the past, but the second anticipates an action in the future. The future-tense form, will receive, fits well here.

</details>

- 
43.	 Although Eddie _____ (to dance) happily, Shirley turned off the music.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

43.
**was dancing (Although Eddie was dancing happily, Shirley turned off the music.)**
The second portion of the sentence refers to an action in the past (turned). The first portion is also in the past. Because the action was ongoing and only one person was performing it (Eddie), the singular past progressive tense form, was dancing, works best in this sentence.

</details>

- 
44.	 Clancy never _____ (to brush) his teeth by himself, even though he is five years old now.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

44.
**brushes (Clancy never brushes his teeth by himself, even though he is five years old now.)**
The sentence refers to an ongoing action, so present tense is best here. Clancy is just one person, so the singular form, brushes, fits the sentence.

</details>

- 
45.	 As we speak, our enemies _____ (to attack) with great force, but we will not surrender.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

45.
**are attacking (As we speak, our enemies are attacking with great force, but we will not**
surrender.) The key expression in this sentence is as we speak, which tells you that you are in the midst of an action. More than one person (enemies) performs this action, so the plural form is appropriate. Therefore, are attacking, the present progressive plural form, is just what you need.

</details>

- 
46.	 The teacher _____ (to staple) the drawings on the bulletin board so that the parents could admire their children’s artwork.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

46.
**stapled (The teacher stapled the drawings on the bulletin board so that the parents could**
admire their children’s artwork.) The key phrase here is could admire, because the helping verb could indicates that the action in this sentence is in the past. (Could is the past tense of can.) Go for the past- tense verb stapled.

</details>

- 
47.	 By the time Eleanor and Henry are satisfied with the renovation, they _____ (to exceed) their budget by a wide margin.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

47.
**will have exceeded (By the time Eleanor and Henry are satisfied with the renovation,**
they will have exceeded their budget by a wide margin.) The sentence includes a deadline in the future (by the time Eleanor and Henry are satis- fied), and the action of exceeding takes place before that deadline. Future perfect tense is made for this situation: an action before a deadline. Therefore, will have exceeded is the verb form you need.

</details>

- 
48.	 Where the tulips _____ (to bloom), weeds eventually covered every inch of the garden.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

48.
**had bloomed (Where the tulips had bloomed, weeds eventually covered every inch of the**
garden.) The tulips’ blooming is the earlier of two actions in the past, because the sentence tells you that weeds replaced them. Use past perfect tense, had bloomed, for the earlier of two past-tense actions.

</details>

- 
49.	 In Maya’s fantasy novel, a wizard’s curse_____ (to turn) a little boy into a frog.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

49.
**turns (In Maya’s fantasy novel, a wizard’s curse turns a little boy into a frog.)**
To write about literature, use present tense, because the action you describe begins anew every time someone reads the book.

</details>

- 
50.	 Amanda and her friends _____ (to study) Chinese for four years by the time they travel to that country.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

50.
**will have studied (Amanda and her friends will have studied Chinese for four years by the**
time they travel to that country.) The deadline in the sentence, by the time, indicates that future perfect tense is appro- priate. Amanda and her friends is a plural subject, but luckily, in the future perfect both the singular and plural forms are the same, will have studied.

</details>

- 
51.	 Joe _____ (to practice) karate for many years and still takes an advanced class every Saturday.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

51.
**has practiced (Joe has practiced karate for many years and still takes an advanced class**
every Saturday.) The present perfect tense connects the past and the present. In this case Joe’s lessons began in the past and continue still. Joe is a singular form. Therefore, the singular, ­present perfect form, has practiced, is what you want here.

</details>

- 
52.	 In Shakespeare’s Othello, the title charac- ter wrongly _____ (to trust) Iago, one of the most evil villains in literature.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

52.
**trusts (In Shakespeare’s Othello, the title character wrongly trusts Iago, one of the most**
evil villains in literature.) To discuss a literary work, use present tense (trusts, in this sentence), because the action begins anew every time the play is read or performed.

</details>

53.	 LGA Manufacturing has an old-fashioned policy; the company _____ (to market) its products only in a store, not on the Internet.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

53.
**markets (LGA Manufacturing has an old-fashioned policy; the company markets its**
­products only in a store, not on the Internet.) The first verb in the sentence, has, is in present tense, and the second portion of the sentence gives you no reason to change time periods. A company, though composed of many workers, is singular, so the singular, present-tense markets is best here.

</details>

- 
54.	 If my dog buries a bone every three days, how many _____ (to bury) by the end of the month?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

54.
**will have been buried (If my dog buries a bone every three days, how many will have**
been buried by the end of the month?) The deadline in the sentence (by the end of the month) signals the need for future ­perfect tense, will have been buried.

</details>

- 
55.	 In Dickens’s classic novel Great Expectations, Pip _____ (to learn) the identity of his benefactor in a chilling scene.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

55.
**learns (In Dickens’s classic novel Great Expectations, Pip learns the identity of his bene-**
factor in a chilling scene.) In the world of literature, present tense rules, so learns is the form you seek. Why ­present? Every time a reader opens the book, the action takes place again.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

56.
**strolled (In my dream, a giant dinosaur ran into my dining room, and then he strolled**
around the room.) The meaning of this sentence doesn’t call for a shift in time. Because the first verb (ran) is in past tense, the second (strolled) should also be in past tense.

</details>

- 
57.	 Perhaps because the president _____ (to campaign) for the mayor, the mayor won by a huge margin.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

57.
**campaigned (Perhaps because the president campaigned for the mayor, the mayor won**
by a huge margin.) You know the election is in the past, because the mayor won. Therefore, the first verb is also in the past, so campaigned is the form you want.

</details>

58.	 Linda _____ (to enter) the cafeteria and sits next to the most hated teacher in the entire school!

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

58.
**enters (Linda enters the cafeteria and sits next to the most hated teacher in the entire**
school!) The clue here is sits, a present-tense verb. The sentence gives you no reason to change time periods, so you know you need a present-tense verb in the blank. Linda is just one person; therefore, go for the singular form, enters.

</details>
